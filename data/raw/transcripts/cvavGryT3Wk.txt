[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   Good morning, Brigham Community Church and those of you who are online as well.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.200]   We have a couple of announcements before we get started.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:56.200]   First of all, on February 20th, the BAM is having a BAM group, our young adults are having fellowship with a seminar that's being led by Pastor Mark.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:01.200]   And so if you haven't signed up for that, email Pastor Mark Lim and he'll give you directions for that.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.200]   So that's coming up on February 20th.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   If you have children in the youth group, this coming Saturday there is an all-day event for the students at 1 o'clock.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:17.200]   And so you'll need to bring your students to church at 1 o'clock this Saturday and they'll be done at 8 p.m.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   Okay, so they said to come and bring dinner money, I think it says $10, and to drop the kids off at church before 1 o'clock.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   And then you can pick them up after 8 o'clock for the youth group.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   Okay, and then for those of you who have children in the seats, so starting from today, obviously, the seats department is opened up.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:44.200]   Yeah, the seats department, the children's department are opened up.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   So just so that there's no confusion, if you have people who are coming that you'll, before you used to have worship here and then drop the kids off,
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.200]   they said to bring the children directly before the service and that they'll receive the children before.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.200]   And then they're going to see how things go.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   And if things go smoothly within the next month, they'll probably open up more classes for the younger ones.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.200]   Okay, just to kind of give you a heads up.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.200]   All right, so we'll give you a minute to take some time for the offering.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.200]   And then again, if you have physical offering, it'll be in the back.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.200]   All right, let's pray.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.200]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your continued blessing and guidance over us.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.200]   Thank you for persevering, Lord God, even in our weakness.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   Lord, we praise you that it is not by our own righteousness, that our work that we can ever merit, Lord God, our presence with you.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:44.200]   I pray, Father, that as we pray in the name of Christ, that we continue to walk by his grace.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   Help us, Lord God, to recognize our continued desperateness without him.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:56.200]   And even today, as we have time of communion, that it would refresh and renew and cause us to remember why we are gathered together.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:03.200]   Lord, help us to be anchored in Christ what we do, that even in our giving may it be multiplied and magnified for your use.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.200]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   [MUSIC - "IN THE NAME OF THE LORD"]
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:25.680]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke 22, verse 15.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:32.680]   We're going to take some time this morning,
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.400]   before I jump into the book of Hebrews,
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.080]   to talk about the significance of communion.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:45.200]   So there's some people who may go to church in and out,
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.840]   and they're, again, not really understanding
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.600]   the significance of some of the things that we do at church.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.800]   And so there's a tendency to think
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.960]   that the most important things that we need to practice
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.680]   is tell us what to do.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.720]   How do we raise children about finance, about evangelism,
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.840]   about making disciples?
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.760]   But when it comes to maybe baptism and communion,
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.520]   those are things for religious people, for the pastors.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.080]   We learned this in seminary.
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.400]   But for the regular people, it really doesn't matter.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.360]   There's nothing in the Bible that
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.080]   differentiates between-- these are important for pastors,
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.960]   but regular people, it doesn't matter.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.600]   When the Bible says not to turn from it
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.160]   to the left or to the right, that's
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.360]   a command for the whole church, for all of us.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.000]   So we need to be careful that we don't participate in things
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.400]   that we don't understand for religious reasons.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.960]   Because if you look at the nation of Israel,
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.640]   before they went into captivity, they were very religious.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.800]   They were at the temple doing what God told them to do,
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.000]   and yet God would call them evil assemblies,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.720]   that their worship was a burden to them,
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.240]   because they were going through it through the motion,
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.280]   obeying the letter of the law.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.680]   But they have no understanding of the spirit of the law, why
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.160]   God gave those laws to begin with.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.400]   So we want to make sure that as a church, that we are not just
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.920]   reformed in theology, but that we are continuing to reform.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.760]   That everything that we are doing in church,
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.080]   we're doing out of obedience to what we see in scripture.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.000]   And so obviously, this leads us to communion.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.840]   Communion is one of those things that, if we don't understand
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.720]   what we're doing, it just becomes a religious practice
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.240]   that we do.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.360]   And so, oh, it means the body, it means the blood,
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.360]   but why do we do it this way?
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.360]   You do it that way, this church does it that way,
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.800]   so it must not be significant.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.480]   Since there is no complete agreement,
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.920]   so whenever there isn't 100% agreement,
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.840]   it must not be important.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.400]   And it's dangerous for us to approach the scriptures
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.720]   that way, because there isn't 100% agreement in anything
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.600]   in scripture, even the gospel.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.800]   And so if we dismiss something simply because there
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.320]   isn't 100% agreement, we are in danger of us picking
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.860]   and choosing what we think is important, what's not important.
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.440]   So we want to make sure that, as we continue to practice
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.360]   communion, that this is taught in our BCC class,
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.240]   but we also want to make sure that,
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.640]   whether you are new to the church
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.240]   or whether you've been here for a while,
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.880]   that there's nothing that we do, especially the communion table,
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.800]   which is so sacred, in a way that we don't fully
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.080]   get what we're doing and why we're doing what we're doing
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.580]   and how we're doing what we're doing.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:13.780]   So we want to take some time.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.640]   And again, I'm probably already turned off some of you, right?
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.200]   We're going to spend the whole day just talking about communion.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.080]   But again, we believe it's important enough
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.760]   that we want to make sure we're on the same page.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.800]   Luke chapter 22, 15, again, we're
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.120]   going to be in various passages.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.840]   But we want to look at the central thing
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.800]   that Jesus gave us before and what initiated this communion,
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.440]   this Lord's table.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.960]   In Luke 22, verse 15, he said to them,
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.320]   I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.960]   before I suffer.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.860]   This is before Jesus goes to the cross.
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.940]   Verse 19, and when he had taken some bread and given thanks,
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.780]   he broke it and gave it to them, saying,
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.920]   this is my body, which is given for you.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.120]   Do this in remembrance of me.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.740]   And in the same way, he took the cup after they had eaten,
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.440]   saying, this cup, which is poured out for you,
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.320]   is the new covenant in my blood.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.040]   So let's pray.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.960]   And then we'll jump into the text.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.840]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your continued grace.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.840]   Help us to have a deepening understanding
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:17.160]   of what you have commanded the church to practice,
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.980]   the significance of it, and what it was given us for,
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.620]   that we would be sustained, strengthened,
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.900]   and to be matured, Lord God, so that we may be anchored
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.360]   in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.500]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.340]   Amen.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:37.560]   Again, if you've been raised in the church--
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.260]   so maybe your parents were Christians,
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.820]   or maybe you went to church early,
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.580]   in elementary school or high school--
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.960]   there are certain things that you
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.140]   can do without fully engaging, without fully understanding
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.780]   why these things are done.
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.860]   Every once in a while, somebody might challenge you and say,
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.300]   oh, yeah, why do we do that?
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.000]   Or maybe you'll go to another church that
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.420]   practices it a different way.
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:01.620]   And then you might ask, huh, I wonder why they do it this way.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:05.940]   And then so you might dig further to properly understand.
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.580]   Or you might just say, well, we have differences of opinion,
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.260]   but we don't really dig further.
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.260]   And then we have the superficial questioning of,
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.860]   why are there denominations?
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.600]   Why can't we just get along?
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.160]   God clearly must not be happy with denominations.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.640]   So therefore, anything that causes
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.840]   any kind of division in the church
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.080]   should not be emphasized too much.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.840]   Let's just talk about what we agree on.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.680]   Jesus loved us, died for us, resurrected on the third day,
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.640]   and we should gather together to celebrate that.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.920]   And outside of that, don't talk about it too much,
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.600]   or it'll divide the church.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.160]   That is the misunderstanding, and again,
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.200]   a very dangerous approach to the scripture,
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.520]   because by doing so, all kinds of false doctrines
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.960]   enter into the church, because we're not paying attention.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.160]   We have to make sure that we understand all of scripture,
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.520]   that we are practicing all of it.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.080]   In fact, I have found that the more we pay attention
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.840]   to scripture, the more we practice the details
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.560]   of what the scripture says, I actually
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.200]   find a greater unity, not only within the church,
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.840]   even outside the church.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.380]   Whenever I see another pastor, another church,
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.680]   that really is dedicated to the verse by verse,
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.040]   careful analysis of what the scripture says,
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.840]   I find complete union with that person, or with that church.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.920]   More than, you could say you're a Baptist,
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.680]   or just have a name title, but you're not
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.040]   studying the scripture, and superficially we seem united,
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.480]   but in reality we're not.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.800]   You know where it first hit me, where there's so many
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.320]   traditions that we practice, that we don't really
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.000]   understand, was when I first started officiating weddings.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.780]   'Cause I grew up in the church, so I just assumed
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.580]   a lot of things, I just saw what my parents did,
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.400]   what my dad did, or what I was taught,
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.900]   and I just started practicing it in the church,
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.980]   'cause the seminary doesn't, at least the seminary
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.900]   I went to, doesn't teach us how to do all these things.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.220]   We learn the scripture, but the practice of it,
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.660]   it's not really emphasized.
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.300]   But I remember the very first wedding that I officiated,
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.300]   I was very nervous.
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.340]   I was very nervous because it's a very important time,
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.500]   and you have adults, and children,
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.480]   and all different groups of people from various
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.800]   backgrounds coming, and I wanted to make sure
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.960]   that I did it right.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.140]   So I felt more nervous than the very first time
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.360]   I gave my sermon, 'cause I wanted to make sure
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.200]   I got it right.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.320]   But obviously I didn't know what I was doing.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.080]   So I was going off of what I remembered, right?
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.240]   I remember what my wedding was like,
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.320]   or a wedding that I participated, so I was just
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.120]   getting things from, just from memory.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.560]   And this is before Google, right?
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.240]   I couldn't just go to the internet and say,
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.940]   okay, what is a Christian wedding supposed to look like?
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.300]   What are the elements you're supposed to do and not do?
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.860]   So I was just going off of memory, I was asking people,
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.120]   but again, there weren't a lot of people that I could ask
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.460]   at that time.
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.880]   So I remember the very first wedding,
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.420]   and it was a former youth student that used to be
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.940]   in my youth group, graduated, met her fiance,
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:59.920]   asked me to officiate the wedding.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.500]   And I remember the practice.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.980]   We showed up, and any of you who participated
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:06.800]   in that wedding, there's a lot of like,
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.560]   you should do this and you shouldn't do this, right?
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.800]   So they started asking me questions.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.520]   Where do we stand?
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.840]   So I'm just remembering.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.040]   You just stand right there, you know?
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.960]   Well, where do the grooms, where do they stand?
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.980]   I guess you stand here.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.360]   And during the ceremony, like, there's an announcement.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.720]   Who gives the announcement?
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.840]   I guess the father does, so I'm just trying to remember
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.400]   all this stuff, and then all throughout the thing,
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.800]   I'm trying to remember the tradition,
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.600]   but I don't remember the significance.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.680]   And I remember thinking, I don't know if I saw it
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.600]   in a wedding or I saw it in a movie somewhere.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.000]   You know, I know that they throw rice at people.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.560]   Like, is that Christian?
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.920]   Like, it's like, okay, I don't understand that.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.600]   And then there's a part of the wedding where they would ask,
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.820]   if anybody has anything against these two people
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.840]   getting married, you know, speak now, forever,
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.200]   hold your peace.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.960]   That's a weird thing to ask in the middle of a wedding.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.840]   And I was thinking, they should have said that
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.880]   before they came to the wedding.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.840]   Why are they waiting until right before they get married
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.660]   to say that?
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.400]   I said, no, I'm not gonna do that, right?
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.320]   And I remember just kind of trying to figure this out
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.920]   at the practice, and one of the moms asked me,
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.420]   the mom of the groom, you know, the side that I didn't know.
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:25.280]   I knew the bride's side, but I didn't know the groom's side.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.360]   She asked me, like, at the end of the wedding,
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.000]   who's supposed to go out first, right?
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.280]   Do the groom's side go out first,
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.840]   or do the bride's side go out first?
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.200]   And I was just like, hmm.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.200]   And I hesitated for a minute, for a second, you know,
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.200]   'cause trying to figure out, I'm winging this thing
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.480]   from the beginning to the end, right?
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.420]   I didn't wanna act like I didn't know what I was doing.
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:49.000]   But the mother of the bride saw that I was hesitating,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.440]   and she grabbed the other mother of the groom
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.080]   and pulled her aside and whispered in her ear
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.880]   where I heard, don't ask him because he doesn't know either.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.720]   That's what she said.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.480]   And I was so nervous going into that practice,
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.640]   but after she said that, I was like, okay, there you go.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.360]   Forget this, you know, this is gonna be a big joke.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.280]   After that, obviously, after that wedding,
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.760]   we got through it, and starting from the next wedding,
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.880]   I wanted to make sure, right?
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.040]   Why is the bride wearing white?
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.600]   Why is theirs a middle isle?
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.060]   Why do they light candles?
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.840]   Why is there thanking of the parents?
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.760]   Why is there this?
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.720]   Why is there benediction?
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.320]   Why is there, how do they pray for this?
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.040]   And so I wanted to make sure.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.740]   And then, so I just kinda took out the things
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.520]   that I didn't fully understand,
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.520]   and I realized that there wasn't really a standard.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.160]   It's not like a biblical standard,
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.440]   like the Bible says to do this,
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.440]   'cause there is no instructions in the Bible.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.520]   It just came from tradition.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.760]   So which tradition you follow.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.200]   So you'll see, if you go to a wedding,
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.160]   their basic elements are similar.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.120]   I would say 90% is similar, and then there's 10%.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.700]   You know, sometimes they take off their shoes
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.920]   and wash their feet and do various things.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.160]   But there is no you can or cannot do
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.320]   because it's not instructed in the Bible, right?
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.140]   Now, I say all of that to introduce to you,
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.380]   sometimes the things that we do in the church,
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.540]   we don't really realize is that biblical
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:11.140]   or is that not biblical, because it's just been done.
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:11.960]   It's tradition.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.620]   If you go to church, you're supposed to be baptized, right?
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:19.300]   You give offerings, somebody gives a sermon,
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.260]   you know, and then we have fellowship,
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.420]   and then we have discipleship, we have evangelism,
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.260]   we have short-term mission.
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.460]   So you have all these elements that the churches do,
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.220]   and there's some things that are clearly biblical
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.420]   that's being taught, and then there are some things
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.460]   that may be biblical, but you don't understand
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.460]   the meaning behind it, but you just do it out of tradition,
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.540]   right, 'cause it was taught.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.220]   But because you do it out of tradition
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.860]   and you don't understand the significance of what it is,
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.220]   it doesn't benefit you the way it's supposed to.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.940]   It is ordained for a reason.
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.780]   The Bible gives us two ordinances,
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.860]   the baptism and communion that is elevated
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.780]   above everything else that we do at church.
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.660]   It's not because we elevated it, the Bible elevated it,
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.800]   and this is universal in all the churches.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.820]   Whether you are a Presbyterian or a Methodist
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.340]   or whatever denomination you come from,
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:12.620]   the fact that these two ordinances were given to us
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:15.340]   in the church is agreed upon.
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:19.440]   The meaning and practice of it may be different,
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.300]   but the fact that they are ordained in the church
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.020]   to be elevated and to be taken seriously
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.260]   is universally accepted.
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:32.500]   So as we practice communion, we wanna make sure
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.500]   that just like we're doing baptism,
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.220]   we're reviewing baptism, and are we practicing it
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.840]   the way that the Bible teaches,
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.780]   and are there biblical things that we can stand upon
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.740]   and give you evidence that this is the reason
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:44.980]   why we do what we do.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:47.300]   In the same way, we wanna make sure that our church,
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.680]   not just the pastors, not just the elders,
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.060]   our church understands this thing
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.140]   that we do every other month, right?
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.020]   Some of you may come from churches that do it every week.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.980]   Some of you came from churches that did it once a month.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:00.180]   Some of you may have come from churches
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.260]   that don't practice it at all.
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:04.420]   Why do they do it that way?
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.580]   Why do we choose to do it every other week, right?
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:11.060]   What are the ways and what are the reasoning behind this?
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:14.400]   So the text that we read in Luke 22, 15 to 19,
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.980]   to start off, it clearly says that Jesus,
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.300]   as he was participating in the Passover meal,
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.820]   he says, "To do this in remembrance of me."
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.480]   In other words, what the Jews were doing,
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:31.380]   what the Israelites were doing to commemorate the Passover
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:36.380]   was now to be taken and to be applied to Christ, right?
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:40.580]   So the most clearest understanding of the communion
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.980]   comes from the Lord's table, before Jesus goes to the cross,
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.260]   "To do this in remembrance of me."
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.420]   So the first part, I wanna make sure that we understand
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.980]   what did the Bible teach us about the meaning behind this?
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:58.260]   I'm gonna go over the first different views
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:59.540]   that people have of communion,
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.940]   and then I'll start with the meaning
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.940]   behind the Baptist meaning.
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.820]   The Roman Catholics believe in transubstantiation,
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.380]   which literally means that the elements
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.820]   actually physically become the blood of Christ
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:14.120]   and the body of Christ.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.540]   It actually converts into that.
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.420]   Obviously, we don't believe that,
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.020]   but that's what the Catholics believe.
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:22.580]   The Lutherans believe in consubstantiation,
[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:25.260]   that they're a step below that,
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.980]   where they don't think that the elements
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.180]   actually turn into the body and the blood,
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.140]   but the actual body and the blood
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:34.900]   appears at the communion table, with, alongside.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.760]   That's what consubstantiation means.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.380]   Obviously, we don't believe that either.
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.780]   The Presbyterians believe
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:43.020]   what's called a sacramental memorial.
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.780]   Sacramental memorial is the primary meaning behind it
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.660]   is a memorial, is for the purpose of remembering.
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.700]   But it's a sacramental memorial,
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:55.020]   meaning that they believe in the dynamic presence of Christ,
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.220]   that in the element of itself, when it is participated,
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:03.220]   there is grace given to everybody in the element itself.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:07.640]   So there is a dynamic presence of Christ in the communion.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:12.260]   The Baptist view of the communion is memorial
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.900]   for the purpose of remembering, reviving.
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:19.580]   It's kind of like celebrating an event,
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.380]   and you have a memorial in order to remind people
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.300]   so that we do not forget,
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.100]   so that whatever it is that we are to do going forward,
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:27.940]   that we don't forget.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.940]   That's why when you have important events in history,
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.060]   they set up memorials, right?
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.280]   If you go to New York, they have memorials
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.620]   for the people who died there,
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:38.980]   and they have a memorial for the firefighters
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.680]   and for the police officers
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.820]   who gave their life in sacrifice.
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.500]   Why do they have that there?
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.620]   So that people will not forget the sacrifice,
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:49.100]   that they may be honored for the life
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.420]   that they gave for that purpose.
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:51.980]   That's why they have memorials.
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:54.780]   So baptism, from our point of view,
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.020]   from what I see in scripture, what Jesus says,
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:02.020]   to do this in remembrance of me, in remembrance of me.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.940]   So when we participate in this communion,
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.540]   there is no power in these elements.
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.240]   You can't take this into your car
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.760]   and then drink it, it's like, I feel it, right?
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:13.920]   There is no power in itself.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.280]   You can't just participate in it.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.840]   Somehow God has ordained this bread
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.320]   and God has ordained this drink,
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.480]   and all of a sudden there's something supernatural
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.040]   going on inside because you happen to participate in it.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.800]   It's what it signifies,
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:30.960]   and what it causes us to remember as a memorial
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.100]   that has the benefit, right?
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.640]   So if we think that way, some people think that,
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.340]   well, if that's the case, if it's just a memorial,
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:41.180]   why do we take it seriously?
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.840]   It's just a symbol, can we do anything, right?
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.720]   We're gonna get to that, right?
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.240]   Because the Bible doesn't present it,
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.820]   even though it is a memorial,
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:49.860]   the Bible just doesn't say,
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.960]   well, since it's a memorial, it's not important.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.420]   In fact, it is very sacred, right?
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:58.940]   It is only one of two ordinances given to us.
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:00.880]   The word ordinance,
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.740]   before we get into the meaning of the Passover,
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:06.140]   the word ordinance, at some point,
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.500]   I forget if it was in November or December,
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.180]   remember the governor of the state passed an ordinance
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.640]   that there was going to be a curfew at 10 o'clock.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.180]   So what does that ordinance mean?
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.860]   A law, right?
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:21.760]   A law that is passed that everyone is supposed to obey,
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.540]   which nobody obeyed.
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:25.380]   I don't know a single person who even knows
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.440]   that that even existed, right?
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.420]   People didn't take it seriously,
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.940]   but at least that's what it means by an ordinance,
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:35.660]   like a set of rules that's supposed to govern
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.900]   wherever that law has authority.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.940]   And so the scripture, in the scripture,
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:42.740]   the local church, two ordinances have been given,
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.980]   the baptism and the Lord's Supper.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:47.500]   So we want to make sure,
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.460]   we want to make sure that the Bible is handled correctly.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.220]   We want to make sure that the fellowship reflects
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:54.640]   who God is, that we do evangelism.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.300]   But above all the things that the church
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.020]   has been called to do,
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:02.820]   there's only two things that are elevated as an ordinance,
[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:05.100]   baptism and communion.
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.560]   So we want to make sure, right?
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.740]   We want to make sure that we don't just simply dismiss that
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:11.180]   and say, "Oh, we're not completely united,
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:12.420]   "so therefore it's not important."
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.060]   It's an ordinance.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.900]   You can't simply say, "We're not united,
[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:17.280]   "so it's not important."
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.780]   It's because it's important
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:22.620]   that we need to pay extra attention
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:25.020]   that we apply it biblically.
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:29.380]   And so that's why we visited about the baptism
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.740]   and certain things are being taught
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.160]   and certain things being practiced,
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.640]   because we want to be,
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.840]   we want to respect what the Bible says,
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.800]   not to turn from it to the left or to the right.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.200]   And we want to do the same thing when it comes to communion,
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.180]   that you understand that this thing
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:45.040]   that we do every other month,
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.420]   what is the significance of it
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:47.620]   and what is it supposed to do
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:50.320]   and why do we practice it the way that we practice it?
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.720]   So, first of all,
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.300]   because Jesus said in the Passover meal
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.300]   to do this in remembrance of me,
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.440]   there's three things that the Passover meal
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.600]   was supposed to cause them to remember.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.440]   Three things.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.260]   The first thing is,
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:09.480]   the first thing of the Passover meal
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:12.680]   was a celebration of God's deliverance of Israel.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:16.280]   That's the clearest and the obvious
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.360]   and the plainest teaching of the Passover meal.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.400]   So, you remember the Passover where God's Spirit comes
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.200]   and he judges the nation of Egypt
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:28.560]   and he says to put the lamb's blood on the doorpost
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.080]   and as a result of the lamb's blood,
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:34.500]   the angel of death crosses over and they are delivered.
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.800]   So, that's why it's called the Passover.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:39.320]   So, every time they commemorated this,
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:43.160]   the Passover, they would remember by God's protection,
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.800]   the lamb of the blood caused them to be saved.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.040]   And that's what it says in Exodus chapter 13, three.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.280]   Moses said to the people,
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.280]   "Remember this day in which you went out from Egypt,
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.860]   "from the house of slavery, for by a powerful hand,
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:57.720]   "the Lord brought you out from this place
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.360]   "and nothing leavened shall be eaten."
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:04.240]   And so, every time they had that Passover meal,
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.580]   it was to remind them of God's deliverance for them.
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.780]   That the only reason why they even exist
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.160]   is because God was merciful.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.660]   God delivered them.
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.920]   They didn't work hard to get out of slavery.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.140]   They didn't overpower the Egyptians.
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.280]   God supernaturally had mercy,
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:24.360]   had a power encounter with the Egyptian idols
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.240]   and delivered them by mercy.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.600]   So, it was to constantly cause them to remember,
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.280]   you live because of him.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.240]   That's what they were to remember.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.720]   And so, when we come to the New Testament,
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.960]   when Jesus says to do that in remembrance of me,
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.480]   he says all of that, what Israelites were doing
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.880]   was to prepare for the real deliverance
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.180]   that was gonna come in Christ.
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.120]   In 1 Corinthians 11, 26,
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.880]   "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.020]   "you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.600]   "just so that we would not forget."
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.000]   That we would not forget.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.240]   Again, I think in the last 10 years,
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.560]   there was this movement, the gospel-centered movement.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.680]   We need to get back to the gospel.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:11.000]   And I think the important part of that movement
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:11.960]   was it's true.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:17.600]   The moment we begin to drift away from what saved us,
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.360]   we can easily drift to think
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.520]   and to be sidetracked to think somehow
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.780]   that if we work hard enough,
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.280]   if we find the right method,
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.300]   if we write the right books,
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:27.240]   if we had the right leader,
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.480]   somehow revival is going to come.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:35.040]   It was to constantly cause the nation of Israel to remember
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:38.840]   so that they do not drift from their salvation.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.520]   And it is to remind us.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.340]   Because there's so many things in our life
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.960]   that can easily cause us to be distracted.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:50.320]   If you were going to Hawaii on a little,
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.520]   tiny little sailboat, right?
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:55.300]   You may have heard this illustration before,
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:51:00.300]   but you don't need to change the boat from here to here
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.400]   to get you off target.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.440]   All you need is a slight change of direction
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.840]   that in the beginning seems like nothing,
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.560]   but after you've traveled four or five miles,
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.400]   you could be hundreds of miles away.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:15.320]   And that's why when the Bible says not to drift,
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.040]   drifting is when we're not clearly anchored in Christ,
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:22.280]   little things that we do causes us to drift toward things
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.340]   ultimately will lead us completely away from God.
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.680]   So when people fall away from God,
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.800]   most of the time they can't point to something,
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:32.240]   it's like, oh, this is when I decided to fall away from God.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.720]   They can't have, there's not a clear point where it says,
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.340]   oh, I rejected God at this point.
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:40.920]   At some point in their life, they gave into their compromise.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.000]   At some point in their life,
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.380]   they didn't take their faith seriously.
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:48.200]   At some point in their life, they began to slightly drift.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.040]   And that slight drift a year later, five years later,
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.240]   10 years later, 30 years later,
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.600]   you end up waking up one day, how did I get here?
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:56.900]   I remember when I was in college,
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.600]   I was willing to give my life for Christ.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.080]   I was going to missions, I wanted to marry a missionary,
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.400]   and I wanted to do all this stuff.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:07.720]   20 years later, after a tiny compromise, one after another,
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.640]   you realize you are so far away from God,
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.600]   and you can't pinpoint exactly when this happened.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.540]   It just happened because we forgot.
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.240]   We just continued to drift.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.040]   God knew.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:21.880]   God knew exactly what our tendency is.
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:24.600]   And I think there's many of us, even in this room,
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.040]   and all over the world,
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.520]   who they can look back at a certain stage in their life
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.660]   and say, you know, man, I wish I could turn the clock back
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.980]   to when I was back then.
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:37.160]   But now the worries of life, concerns about retirement,
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.880]   about paying bills, about raising children
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.360]   has got me all caught up, and I've drifted.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:46.440]   And I know I've drifted, but how do I get back?
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:49.440]   You know, our human tendency is,
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.600]   when we see people drifting,
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.120]   like we have to switch programs.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.960]   We have discipleship programs.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.000]   You know, we have leadership programs.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.540]   We have one-to-one programs.
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:02.480]   We have older brothers looking out for younger brothers,
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.560]   senior to freshman.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.800]   And so we establish all of these things,
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.680]   saying like, if we wanted to get back to God,
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:10.880]   we need to implement this.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.800]   Well, none of those things are wrong,
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.340]   but none of those things
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:17.840]   are explicitly written in scripture.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.440]   The only thing that is explicitly written in scripture
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.280]   is to fix your eyes upon Christ,
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:25.080]   the author and perfecter of our faith.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.200]   We've been studying the book of Hebrews
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:30.900]   because they were drifting away, right?
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.560]   They weren't denouncing his deity.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.040]   They weren't saying that he wasn't resurrected from Christ.
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.000]   They just drifted.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.900]   They didn't take seriously the weightiness of what they had.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:42.380]   So because they were drifting,
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.880]   the solution to their drifting is Christ.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:50.120]   So we spent 10 chapters, from chapter one to chapter 10,
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.060]   and then in chapter 11,
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:55.040]   being reminded about the supremacy of Christ.
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:59.080]   Because what God gave us so that we do not drift
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:02.840]   is to constantly remember what saved us to begin with.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:07.280]   In the book, "Ask Guinness, No God But God,"
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:11.560]   he describes three generations that lead to apostasy.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.600]   The first generation are the ones who convert,
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.440]   and they're the builders.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.560]   They're the sacrificial ones.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.960]   And then their children are the second generation
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.160]   where they become lukewarm,
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.200]   where the passion that they had initially
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.920]   starts to wane at the end of their life,
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.560]   and their children remember
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.240]   who they were at the end of their life.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.680]   And so they inherit the form without the power.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.600]   So they become lukewarm.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.020]   But the lukewarm Christian, at the end of their life,
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:40.560]   begins to drift so far away from God
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.840]   that with the third generation,
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:46.840]   all they remember is the tail end of the lukewarm life.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:50.360]   And so that's how he says in his study,
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.680]   by third generation, there's apostasy.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.400]   So if you're a part of the first generation
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.560]   that received Christ,
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.960]   tendency is, right,
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:00.420]   and don't accept this tendency.
[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:01.640]   We need to fight this tendency.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.040]   But the tendency is,
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:07.520]   if we do not continue to anchor in Christ all our life,
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.240]   our next generation is going to inherit the church,
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.800]   inherit the Sunday school, inherit VBS,
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:17.600]   inherit the form without the passion, without the faith.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.040]   But that's not where apostasy happened.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:21.400]   Apostasy happens in the third generation
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:24.520]   because there was nothing for them to inherit
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.320]   at the tail end of the second generation,
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.920]   and the third generation just walks away from their faith.
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.840]   This is why the communion table is so important.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.320]   Not the form.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:36.200]   Not putting this in our body and say,
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.440]   well, I did it, so I have somehow sustenance,
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.420]   but why it was given to us.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.440]   As a pastor,
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:47.700]   my constant struggle is,
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.720]   when I forget what saved me, what I value,
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.580]   and why I came into ministry,
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:53.960]   it just becomes a job.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:56.140]   It just becomes a job.
[00:55:56.140 --> 00:56:00.060]   And when it just becomes a job, it's unbearable.
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:04.860]   And so I have to constantly fight in my heart,
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.560]   not just through communion, but through devotions,
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:07.800]   through prayer, through fellowship.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:11.000]   I have to constantly remind it, why did I start this?
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.200]   For the moment I drift from that,
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.920]   and it becomes a job, it's not worth it.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:22.560]   As Christians, if you forget and you start to drift,
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:26.740]   eventually, you have to salvage something from the church.
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:29.400]   Because if it's not your devotion,
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:32.200]   if it's not your love for Christ and Christ's love for you,
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.880]   that's drawing you to church,
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:37.460]   something else is drawing you to church.
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:39.600]   And usually it's people.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.760]   So when people are nice to you, when you fit in,
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.520]   and you're loved, and you're part of a community,
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:46.200]   it's great, but as soon as that starts to break down,
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:47.200]   I don't wanna go to church anymore,
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.040]   'cause the church is filled with hypocrites.
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:52.600]   So at some point in their walk with God,
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.520]   the fellowship became the primary thing,
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:58.720]   because they've drifted away from what is central.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.880]   Again, when that happens, there's no,
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:04.180]   you can't pinpoint at one point that happens.
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:07.440]   But you know in your heart when that happens.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.840]   It's no longer the love for Christ,
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:12.240]   it's no longer his sacrifice that's drawing me to him.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.140]   It's the people.
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:17.560]   A church that forgets and begins to drift,
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:20.120]   it becomes nothing more than a social gathering
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:21.520]   for social purposes.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:24.160]   Where you know, we need to salvage,
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.520]   well why are we gathered together?
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.880]   We have these resources, we have homeless people,
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:31.840]   we have sex trafficking, and so we wanna do good.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.600]   And so none of these things are bad things.
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.760]   The Bible tells us that those things
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.200]   ought to be our characters.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.680]   Those things ought to be things that we practice.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.540]   But that is not the central purpose of the church.
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:47.160]   Chuck Colson, in his book, The Church,
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:51.000]   he writes of a story of this church in the South,
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.080]   where this tiny church, they wanted to help
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.360]   for social causes, and there was this lady
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.800]   who was really good at fried chicken.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.240]   And so she started cooking fried chicken,
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.460]   they started raising a lot of money,
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:03.540]   and everybody around town started to hear
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:04.840]   about her fried chicken.
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.060]   And so the fried chicken became the central thing
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:08.320]   at this church.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.800]   The people outside the church would come
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.520]   and buy this fried chicken, but at the same time,
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:15.960]   the core things of the church, preaching the gospel,
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.960]   and teaching the Bible, and fellowship in Christ,
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:20.820]   started getting neglected, and this fried chicken
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:23.200]   started to really take off.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.000]   And they were doing good things with this money,
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.720]   helping the poor.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:30.080]   And he talks about how this church eventually drifted away,
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.800]   ended up shutting down the church,
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.320]   and establishing a fried chicken business.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:40.380]   A church that forgets why we are gathered together
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:44.520]   becomes nothing more than a social gathering.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.220]   And sometimes we're not even aware of it,
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:48.540]   until we start having relational problems,
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:52.280]   and then the church has no longer any meaning.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:56.000]   That's why the communion table has been given to us,
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.520]   so that we do not drift.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.820]   So that we would always focus on Christ.
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.840]   The reason why you and I are gathered together
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.860]   is because he is our salvation.
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.360]   That's what the communion table is to remind us of.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.060]   Secondly, the Passover served to remind Israel
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:13.460]   of God's care and deliverance during times of hardship.
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:15.220]   He says in Deuteronomy 7, 17,
[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:17.320]   "If you should say in your heart,
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.420]   "these nations are greater than I,
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:20.880]   "how can I dispossess them?
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:22.140]   "You shall not be afraid of them.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:24.780]   "You shall well remember what the Lord your God did
[00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:28.020]   "to Pharaoh and to all of Egypt."
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:30.380]   He says, as you wander in the desert,
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:31.700]   as you get into the promised land,
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:34.660]   there's gonna be nations that are much more fortified
[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:35.980]   and stronger.
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:37.820]   You're gonna experience some hunger.
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:39.980]   You're gonna experience some thirsting.
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:41.180]   You're gonna experience trials,
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:44.380]   and maybe some of it that you're not even gonna understand.
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:47.900]   But during those period, remember that God delivered you.
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.500]   God is your deliverance.
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:55.500]   He saved you, so he's also going to sustain you.
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.220]   And so that's what the Passover,
[00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:59.640]   not only to remember what he did in the past,
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.900]   but because of what he has done in the past,
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.100]   how will he not, who saved you from all of that,
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:06.620]   not sustain you, just kind of send you out
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:09.420]   into the wilderness and say, "Good luck, hope you make it."
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:12.180]   And it's to remind them that their strength is in God.
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:14.420]   As long as they are in God, they are saved.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.860]   That's what it was supposed to remind them
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:17.460]   every year at the Passover meal.
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:21.900]   And in the same way, it says in Romans 8.31-35,
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:25.260]   Apostle Paul says, "What then shall we say to these things?
[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:28.280]   "If God is for us, who is against us?
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.840]   "He who did not spare his own son,
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.380]   "but delivered him over for us,
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.200]   "so how will he not also with him
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.240]   "freely give us all things?"
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.520]   That's exactly what the Passover meal was for.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.860]   If he delivered you, if he cared for you enough
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.780]   to deliver you, why would he not sustain you
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.420]   on the path to the promised land?
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:52.340]   If we truly believe that he loved us enough
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.720]   to send his only begotten son.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:00.140]   It is illogical, it is inconsistent.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.520]   To believe in a God who would send his only begotten son
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.120]   and then question what God is going to take care
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.020]   of us financially.
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:11.080]   Whether we're gonna stay healthy or not,
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.800]   or worried about the future.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.520]   Now, obviously, we're human beings,
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.120]   so as long as we live on this earth,
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.400]   there's gonna be things that concern us.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.260]   But in the big scheme of things,
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:25.100]   we're to constantly remember the communion table
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:27.880]   that not only has he justified us,
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.140]   it is by his mercy we are sanctified.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:33.260]   So there is nothing that's gonna happen in our life
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:36.340]   that doesn't come through a sovereign and loving hand.
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:39.740]   So whatever pain that we experience,
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:42.700]   whatever things that we cannot understand,
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.580]   once we understand that God is in the midst of this,
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:48.100]   all of a sudden, it's okay.
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.980]   We can experience pain, but if that pain
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:53.820]   is coming from somebody who's trying to hurt us,
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:58.120]   versus a doctor who's giving surgery,
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:01.840]   and this pain is going to lead to fixing the problem
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.840]   that we came in with, those two different pains
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.360]   have a completely different purpose.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.520]   How we approach it is completely different.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.440]   So in our Christian life, there may be things
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:15.000]   that come in where we need sustenance, we need guidance,
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.200]   before we run to counselors, before we run to friendship,
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.920]   before we run to community, that we come
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.160]   to the communion table and remember,
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.760]   he who did not spare even his own son to deliver us,
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.680]   how will he not, along with him,
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.580]   give us all things that are necessary?
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:33.960]   Sometimes even pain.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:40.240]   Sometimes even pain is given to us for our good.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.740]   That's what the Passover was to remind us of.
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:46.020]   God is with us, he's in our midst.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:49.420]   Second part of Romans 8, 31, again, 33 says,
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.140]   will he bring a charge against God's elect?
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.500]   God is the one who justifies.
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.700]   Who is the one who condemns?
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:58.560]   Christ Jesus is he who died, yes, rather who was raised.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.220]   Who is at the right hand of God?
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.580]   Who also intercedes for us, who will separate us
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.900]   from the love of Christ, will tribulation or distress
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.580]   or persecution or famine or nakedness, peril or sword,
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:08.780]   in other words, nothing.
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:13.260]   Because he justified us, he will sustain us,
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.460]   that's what that means.
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:17.380]   He doesn't justify us and then he send you off
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:19.340]   and he's like, try hard to be sanctified
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.300]   and see if you can make it.
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:25.380]   Said no, if he justified us, he will sanctify us
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.380]   and then he will eventually glorify us.
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:30.420]   And that's what the communion table teaches us.
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:31.860]   It's not just in the beginning.
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.980]   Our very practical needs today, there's a tendency
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.300]   to think the church is good for religious stuff.
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:40.340]   When I wanna think about eternity,
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.660]   when I wanna talk about evangelism,
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.900]   then the church is necessary.
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:48.400]   But pay my bills, raising children,
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:52.880]   retirement, these are things that I need to do.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:53.920]   I need to be good at.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:58.560]   And sometimes again, that causes us to get into trouble
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.280]   and that's what the communion table is.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.240]   Past and present.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:07.760]   But the third reason I think is the most relevant to us
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.720]   for the Passover.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.400]   Because when trials and hardship comes,
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:17.080]   if you are a genuine believer,
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.880]   it causes us to be desperate and to cling to God.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:23.920]   So when persecution comes, it almost always
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.240]   leads to the purification of the church.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.440]   You know, I was reading this week
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.420]   that because of the pandemic and so many people
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:33.520]   who've been online and not physically at church,
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.320]   as an able to be fellowship, participate in Bible study,
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.720]   the surprising number of people who fell away from church,
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.960]   they said 50%.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.600]   So we have no idea when all the churches open,
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.640]   what the church is gonna look like
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.600]   because at least on paper, their survey, 50%.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:56.600]   Out of the 50%, some of them have gone for good.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.680]   Out of the 50%, some of them have moved churches.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.800]   Some of them are in between churches.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.000]   But the 50% is, if you take the totality of the churches,
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.080]   that the people who used to be at that church,
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.260]   50% are no longer at that church.
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:13.480]   Now we may be shocked by that and say,
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.960]   well, I mean, we had hardship
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.000]   and it's actually destroying the church.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.240]   No, that's not destroying the church.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.680]   In fact, when I talked to the Indian pastors,
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.160]   they said with all the persecution that's coming
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.720]   and literally, they don't know
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.560]   if they're gonna walk into the village,
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.340]   if they're gonna get stoned or not,
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.480]   how does that affect you guys?
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.960]   And he said, it's been good because it purified the church.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.580]   Only real Christians come now.
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:42.480]   And so he said, it's bringing revival.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.760]   And so the few who are genuinely walking with God
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.360]   are more fervent in their faith.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.280]   They share more boldly.
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:55.280]   So persecution is not what worries the church.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:58.280]   If our end goal is not safety,
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.640]   if your end goal is safety,
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.400]   if your end goal is to live a good life
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.080]   where your children are raised in a godly home,
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.920]   go to a good church, go to VPS,
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.600]   and then they live a peaceful, comfortable life
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.120]   until they're 80, and then they,
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.520]   if that's your goal, yes,
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.000]   persecution's gonna disturb that.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.400]   If our end goal is to glorify God
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:19.120]   and to share the gospel, persecution is actually good.
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:22.480]   The challenge and the struggle is actually good for us
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.840]   than to live in peace.
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:27.720]   Our problem is not persecution,
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:32.320]   it's in times of peace when we don't feel pressure.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.680]   And our natural tendency is we wanna live
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.220]   where there's a good neighborhood,
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:37.480]   where we don't have to worry about our children.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.400]   Of course, what parent wouldn't?
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.880]   But our natural tendency to live in comfort
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.280]   is what causes us to drift.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.680]   When the storm comes, everybody anchors
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.700]   'cause they see the danger.
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.480]   'Cause if you're not anchored when the storm comes,
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.840]   I mean, you can literally die.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.020]   But we don't drift during the storm.
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.960]   We drift when we don't see the danger.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:03.960]   And that's what he says in Deuteronomy 8, 11.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.240]   "Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.040]   "by not keeping his commandments and his ordinances
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.720]   "and his statues which I am commanding you today.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.440]   "Otherwise, when you have eaten and are satisfied
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.480]   "and have built good houses and lived in them,
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.720]   "and when your herds of your flocks multiply
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.360]   "and your silver and gold multiply
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.040]   "and all that you have multiplies,
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.960]   "then your heart will become proud
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.900]   "and you will forget the Lord and your God
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.820]   "who brought you out from the land of Egypt,
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:29.880]   "out of the house of slavery."
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:33.280]   17, "Otherwise, you may say in your heart,
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:38.040]   "my power and the strength of my hand made me this wealth.
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.580]   "But you shall remember the Lord your God,
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.240]   "for it is he,"
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.440]   look at how many times he says he,
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.120]   "it is he who is giving you the power to make wealth,
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.560]   "that he may confirm his covenant
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.560]   "which he swore to your fathers,
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.600]   "as it is this day."
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.040]   So that was the problem.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.060]   The main problem of the Israelites
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:01.000]   was not when the enemies were coming.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.200]   It wasn't the Midianites.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.280]   It wasn't the Philistines.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.240]   It wasn't the Egyptians.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:09.120]   It was when they were financially stable,
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.800]   when the temple was being used at full force,
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.960]   when everything was being done
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.800]   and they were following the command,
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.600]   the letter of the law,
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.640]   and yet God says, "None of that is for me."
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.440]   Your singing has become a burden.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.760]   Your assembly is evil.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.400]   He said, "Even the music, the instruments that you play,"
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:32.400]   he said, "It's become noise to me."
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.580]   Hosea 13, five through six,
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:36.920]   "I cared for you in the wilderness,
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.320]   "in the land of the drought.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:41.980]   "As they had their pasture, they became satisfied.
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:45.280]   "And being satisfied, their heart became proud.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.500]   "Therefore, they forgot me."
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:50.860]   If you look in the book of Judges,
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:56.140]   right before revival, right,
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:56.980]   there's judgment
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:09:00.080]   because they forgot God.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.780]   So when they were in the greatest danger
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:05.180]   was not when the judgment was there,
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:07.420]   was not when the enemies were attacking
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:08.900]   because when the enemies started to attack,
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.100]   that's when they cried out to God,
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.860]   God had mercy and would raise up a judge
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:15.780]   and through the judge overthrow their enemies
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:17.380]   and then they would celebrate
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:20.300]   and after they celebrated, they became satisfied
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.580]   and once they became satisfied,
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:23.340]   they became proud and they forgot God.
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:27.700]   So the most dangerous period in Israel's cycle
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.180]   is when they were at peace
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:32.620]   because next step is they forgot God.
[01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:34.540]   They became proud and they forgot God.
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:38.140]   Is when we are doing well, our bills are paid
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.540]   and things are going well,
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:41.700]   our natural tendency is I made a good judgment,
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.160]   I bought the house at the right time,
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.620]   I sold it at the right time,
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:47.540]   I put my money at game stop when it was $6
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.620]   and so therefore, if I find two more of these,
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.380]   I can retire by the time I'm 35
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.080]   and when things are going well,
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.140]   that's when we need to be careful.
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.540]   Be careful when you think you stand
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.300]   because that's when you will fall.
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:06.660]   See, the communion, the Passover meal
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:09.380]   was given to us even in times of peace
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:11.100]   to humble us when we come before.
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.620]   Every time we come to the communion table
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:16.040]   is to remind us, you did not get here on your own.
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.300]   You do not come to the table
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:21.580]   because you were good this week
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:24.220]   and you cannot resist the table because you were bad.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:28.900]   The communion table humbles Nicodemus
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:31.580]   and it raises the Samaritan woman
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:34.300]   because the path to Christ is the same.
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:38.500]   It humbles the proud and it lifts up the humble.
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.300]   That's what the communion table does
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:44.580]   and so we are to remember this
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:46.620]   and that's why we participate in this communion
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:47.900]   because once we forget that,
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:51.300]   what it symbolizes, what it was supposed to remind us
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:53.420]   and the moment we start to drift,
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:54.860]   we rely on our own resources,
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:57.140]   we are satisfied where we are at
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:58.740]   and we're no longer desperate.
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:03.600]   And again, when we are the most in danger
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.340]   is when we don't feel this desperateness for Christ
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:10.860]   because our bills are paid, our children are doing well,
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.820]   you have enough money in the retirement,
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:16.300]   all these things that make you a good father, good mother
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.100]   and when you begin to take a step back and say,
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:20.580]   wow, I've done my job, he says, watch out
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:24.580]   because the communion table is to remind us
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.700]   of our constant need for Christ.
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:30.180]   So after saying that, I said,
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:33.020]   well, if you believe in his symbolism,
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:35.580]   why do we take this so seriously if it's just a symbol?
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:38.800]   One, like I said, because it is an ordinance,
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.820]   it is law, this was not suggested,
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.980]   it was commanded in scripture.
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:46.460]   So we're gonna practice it
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:49.580]   but there are a few names that different denominations,
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:52.180]   different groups and even within the same church,
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:55.100]   we may use different names and it conveys
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.480]   some of the things that the Bible teaches
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.620]   why we should take this seriously.
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:02.280]   We've already talked about ordinances, it's commanded,
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.420]   this is not a suggestion that every church
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:07.220]   that is obedient is to practices.
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:11.780]   That's why the parachurches, we don't call them churches
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:15.580]   'cause they have, one of the key factors
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:18.020]   of what a church is is to practice the ordinance.
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:20.180]   You can't say we're not a local church
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:21.020]   so we don't practice it.
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:22.540]   Well, that's not a suggestion,
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:24.580]   it was commanded in scripture, right?
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:26.340]   That's a side thing.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:28.660]   Another word that is used is sacrament.
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:32.380]   We don't normally use the word sacrament
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:34.420]   because there's historical connotations
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:36.460]   attached to that in the Catholic Church
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:38.100]   but the meaning behind it is something
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:38.940]   that we need to understand.
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:42.060]   Sacrament basically means sacred or set apart.
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.080]   Just like when the priests were entering
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.600]   into the Holy of Holies, there was a degree of seriousness
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.580]   that they were to take when they went
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:50.780]   into the Holy of Holies.
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:54.140]   Jesus was angered because the Jews
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:58.980]   were doing selling of other products and animals
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:02.180]   and making profit out the outer court
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:04.620]   where it was supposed to be a place of worship.
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:07.740]   And that's why Jesus says he will be consumed
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:11.040]   with his Father's house, that it ought to be
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:13.460]   a place of worship, of prayer.
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:15.280]   And so that's what the word sacred means,
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.320]   that though it is symbolic and it is a memorial,
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.800]   it is to be taken seriously.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:25.560]   Just like with the baptism, we don't just do it
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:28.040]   because that's what we think or I believe.
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:28.880]   That's what I was taught.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:29.860]   What is the tradition?
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:31.800]   That we do not turn from it to the left or to the right
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:35.660]   because it is an ordinance commanded in scripture.
[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:40.660]   In fact, it is so sacred, in 1 Corinthians 11, 27, 28,
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:43.440]   some people were actually dying
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:48.000]   because they were disrespecting the communion table.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.160]   Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.640]   of the Lord in an unworthy manner shall be guilty
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.400]   of the body and blood of the Lord.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.080]   In other words, you're taking something that is so sacred
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:59.880]   and you're treating it like it's very trivial.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.740]   And so what was happening at Corinth,
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.680]   they were coming together and the rich people were eating
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.520]   and the poor people would not eat.
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.040]   And so by doing that, causing division, right?
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.360]   If you have, you're gonna get together.
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:13.920]   So they weren't acknowledging the communion table itself
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.160]   and so they were participating in an unworthy manner.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.760]   And because God wanted to teach the early church
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.920]   the significance of this ordinance,
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.520]   the consequence of that was some of them
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.720]   were actually dying from this.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.720]   And so though we may not experience that,
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:33.000]   but the point that God was trying to make
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.700]   in the Corinthian church of the sacredness of this event,
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:40.140]   we ought to take seriously because it is meant to be sacred.
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.760]   It is meant to be law,
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:44.000]   that we ought to practice it exactly the way
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.080]   or the way that honors God,
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.040]   that lends to the weightiness
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.240]   of what it is that we are doing.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.280]   The other word that we use in our church
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.960]   that we use commonly is the word communion.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.480]   The word communion literally is koinonia,
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.640]   fellowship, to partner.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.960]   And so the significance behind that
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.480]   is that the communion was to bring the church together,
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.560]   that this is what binds us together.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.880]   So communion was never meant to be done in private.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:11.480]   It is not an event between you and God.
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:12.960]   It was meant to be done in the context
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.800]   of the body of Christ.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.080]   And this is the reason why
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:17.420]   we do not practice communion at home,
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:21.040]   because it is to be done
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:22.840]   at the presence of the whole church.
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.040]   And we do not practice communion at the wedding,
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.040]   because the wedding is not a gathering of the whole church.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:30.880]   It is a segment of the church.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:33.520]   It is not a gathering of the whole church.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.720]   And so we practice communion
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.200]   when the physical body of Christ is gathered together.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.140]   So I know that at the beginning of the pandemic,
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:43.600]   we're discussing about how come we don't let the people
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.520]   who are at home participate in the communion.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.880]   And again, as much as we would like to,
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.800]   we don't want to give disinformation
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.640]   about what the communion is.
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.680]   Communion was meant for the physical gathering of the church,
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.280]   not to be done privately between me and God.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:02.260]   And that's why a long time ago,
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:06.680]   understanding this, we used to practice communion
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:08.640]   with the Hawaiian bread,
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:13.120]   and because that's kind of like the way I learned it.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:15.160]   And so communion, the Hawaiian bread basically means
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.920]   it's one body and everybody participating in one body.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.000]   And so the way I learned it when I was young,
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.520]   again, like I said, I was never taught this at seminary.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.040]   So as I was practicing communion,
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.660]   I was just kind of going off of my memory as a youth student
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:31.840]   what my youth pastor did.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.720]   And so I remember going up to retreats
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.840]   and he would pass around Hawaiian bread.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.060]   And if he didn't have one loaf,
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.000]   it would be just coming in that bag.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.720]   And then we would take pieces.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.400]   And then we didn't have little cups,
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.000]   but he would give us the grape juice boxes.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.400]   So we'd have a box of that, right?
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.640]   Or a cup, but we'd have something with the juice
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:53.720]   and then Hawaiian bread, and then we would eat it.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:54.840]   And then that would be our communion.
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.400]   And after we were finished, we would bring salami.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:00.640]   And then, because salami tastes really good with that bread.
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.080]   And then we would eat the, drink the rest of the,
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:06.780]   you know, grape juice and we would have lunch, right?
[01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:11.480]   So earlier part of the church,
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:14.680]   we kind of had a version of that at church, right?
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.640]   And I, you know, I know this is sacred,
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.160]   but that's kind of what I remember.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.320]   So I remember the first three, four years of the church,
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.000]   we'd have the Hawaiian bread, and then we would practice.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.640]   I would pour the grape juice in a big, big bowl
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.480]   and then take a Hawaiian bread from one loaf
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.480]   and then dip it and then eat it and then go.
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.520]   Like that was what we were practicing.
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.860]   And then after we're done, whatever's left over,
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:37.240]   we would drink and then get salami and then eat it.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.080]   You know what I mean?
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.680]   So we were doing that.
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:42.040]   And then we had a brother who came to church
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.640]   and he was fairly new,
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:46.040]   and then he started practicing communion.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.960]   And he wasn't upset or anything.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.240]   He just kind of passionately said, you know,
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.640]   he saw us like taking the bread
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.880]   and everybody was tearing it to pieces and eating it.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:57.040]   It's like, "I kind of see you sacrilegious."
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.240]   (laughs)
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.760]   Should we be doing that?
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.280]   And then, you know, I just heard it in passing.
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.560]   And I said, "Oh, we do that because, you know,
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.800]   it's one loaf, one bread, and we're doing all that."
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.040]   And then I went home, I was like,
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.240]   "Yeah, that doesn't seem right."
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.680]   Just after years of doing this,
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:13.560]   like maybe we shouldn't do that.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.200]   So I had a meeting with our leadership.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.360]   It's like, maybe we shouldn't be doing that.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.800]   And then we started thinking like,
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.280]   it's supposed to be unleavened bread.
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:22.980]   That's very, you know, sweet.
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:25.880]   Maybe we shouldn't be doing that.
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:28.160]   And then the wine part of it that, you know,
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.520]   we said, "Oh, we just stopped that
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.000]   'cause it was unsanitary."
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:31.840]   You know what I mean?
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.880]   So we found cups and we started doing it differently.
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:36.360]   So we started kind of like, what is the best way?
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:39.560]   What is the best way for us to signify what it means
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.880]   and convey the meaning of significance, right?
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:48.080]   And so that's why when we started practicing the communion,
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:52.900]   we want to make sure that we handle it with sacredness.
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:53.740]   So every once in a while,
[01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:55.000]   somebody would see us stumbling up here,
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.280]   putting it together and throwing it away.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.520]   And somebody would say, "Hey, do you guys need some help?"
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.640]   And you probably had to say,
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:01.880]   "Oh, we don't need your help,
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.400]   even though we're fumbling," right?
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:05.740]   A part of the reason why is because
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:07.280]   we wanted to convey the sacredness
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.560]   of what it is that we are handling.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:10.840]   That this is not just some bread.
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.600]   Even though it is symbolic, it's not just some bread.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.420]   It's not some grape juice.
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:16.060]   That this is sacred enough
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:18.720]   that God has separated this as an ordinance,
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.480]   a command for us, the church, to practice.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.080]   And so even this, you know,
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:27.280]   like this existed a long time ago, you know?
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.440]   And there was some talk about, "Hey, why don't we do this?
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.200]   And it'd be so much easier than to set it up.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.720]   We just buy this and put it on the thing,
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.900]   just throw it away, we'll be done with it."
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:37.880]   Obviously, we introduced this because we're in a pandemic,
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:39.480]   and so we're trying to be sanitary.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.360]   But once this is done, you know,
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.880]   we choose not to practice it this way
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.440]   because of the meaning behind it.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.360]   We want the church to understand
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.440]   that the body of Christ is coming together.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.240]   We're handling the body of Christ
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.940]   and the blood of Christ symbolically, right?
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:55.960]   Same thing with baptism.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.160]   The baptism signifies a death and resurrection.
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:02.200]   So we practice immersion, as the Bible teaches.
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.800]   So once we are done with the pandemic,
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.000]   we're gonna go back to that,
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.520]   but we wanna make sure that everybody understands
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.200]   that that's exactly what we're doing, right?
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:14.400]   To remember Christ's sacrifice, that he's sustaining us,
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.940]   that this is an ordinance, that this is a sacrament.
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:20.280]   This is a communion to remind us that we are one together.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.520]   That's why before we participate in communion,
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.560]   we ask you to think,
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.080]   are there relationship that has been broken
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.120]   that you need to confess?
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.640]   You know, and obviously,
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.800]   it's hard to practice that perfectly,
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.520]   but are there things that you're holding in your heart
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.120]   that you need to confess and reconcile
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.360]   in the body of Christ, right?
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:39.960]   Are we acknowledging the body of Christ,
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.160]   or have we drifted away from the church,
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:45.080]   and we're no longer participating?
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.160]   And to remind us that this is supposed
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.720]   to galvanize us together, the body of Christ.
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.160]   Another word that is used is Eucharist.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:55.840]   Sometimes the Lutheran church uses this term,
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.680]   but the meaning behind Eucharist basically is good grace.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:03.760]   That's where we get the word Thanksgiving, right?
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:07.520]   It's a table of celebration to give thanks, right?
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:09.160]   Maybe you come in and there's things
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:11.400]   that you're not happy about.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.280]   You've been grumbling this week or last week,
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.120]   and there's a lot of things,
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:17.760]   and you have a tendency to articulate things
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:18.600]   that you're frustrated,
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:20.960]   and I catch myself doing that all the time.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:25.040]   And so at the communion table, it is a place to celebrate,
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:28.320]   right, in light of what he has given me,
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.680]   and recalibrate my thoughts, my heart.
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:33.960]   I have way more things to be thankful for
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.200]   than to be concerned about,
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:40.400]   way more things to praise him for than to complain about.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.600]   And so that's what the Eucharist is meant to be.
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.240]   And then the last one, again,
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.000]   this is a term that we often use as well,
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.380]   the Lord's table, right?
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:50.800]   It's meant to be a celebration, to remind us,
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:55.200]   ultimately pointing to the second coming of Christ.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:58.400]   The Bible says in Revelations 19, seven through nine,
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:01.440]   "Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to him
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.920]   "for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:05.560]   "and his bride has made herself ready.
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:08.080]   "It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen,
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.200]   "bright and clean, for the fine linen in the righteousness,
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.900]   "righteous acts of the saints.
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:14.000]   "Then he said to me, right,
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.680]   "blessed are those who are invited
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.800]   "to the marriage supper of the Lamb.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:20.540]   "And he said to me, these are true words of God."
[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:24.040]   So this communion table, the Lord's supper,
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:26.480]   is to remind us, not only did he die for us,
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:27.760]   but because he died for us,
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:31.680]   he's going to take us into eternity.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:34.360]   And in eternity, we're gonna be celebrating
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.880]   in his marriage ceremony.
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.800]   He's the groom and we are the bride
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.540]   and we're gonna participate in this joyous wedding.
[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.120]   People ask me all the time,
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:47.080]   because I told you the first wedding that I did,
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:51.200]   since then, I've counted about 100, right?
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.880]   My guess is about 100 to 120 weddings.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.780]   And people ask me, doesn't it get old?
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.000]   You go to so many weddings,
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.800]   you do the same thing every time.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:03.920]   My honest, honest answer, it does not.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:08.040]   It does not get old, even though it looks the same,
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:09.640]   and sometimes you might hear the sermon
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:12.240]   and you say, oh, I heard that, right?
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:15.340]   And I know I'm preaching to the same people 100 times.
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:17.880]   So I'm aware of the pressure, right?
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:18.800]   So I'm not dumb.
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:22.880]   So it gets harder and harder as it goes, right?
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.740]   But wedding ceremony never gets old
[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:27.660]   because it's the beginning of two people
[01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:29.960]   starting a new life, right?
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:33.680]   Disneyland is not the happiest place in the world.
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:34.880]   I think the wedding banquet
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:37.040]   is the happiest place in the world,
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.680]   where everybody's excited to see these young couple
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:42.480]   celebrate the beginning of a new life.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.320]   They get to go home with their best friend
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.840]   and to be able to be a part of that
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:48.040]   and be a part of that ceremony,
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:50.200]   that part never gets old, right?
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.460]   I never come back from a wedding depressed.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.960]   So the communion table is to remind us
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.240]   of the real celebration, all of that to point
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.120]   to the celebration of the coming of Christ.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:05.600]   And so that's why we wanna lift up the communion
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.140]   that we understand as a church,
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:08.800]   not just the pastors, not just the leaders
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.260]   who make decisions, but the church understands
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:14.280]   what it is that we are doing, right?
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:18.880]   Remember who saved us, remember in times of hardship,
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.700]   remember when things are well,
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:23.160]   that God had given us this ordinance,
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:26.200]   not simply to go through the motion and say we did it,
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.360]   but to remember him and to celebrate him
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.180]   and eagerly anticipate.
[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:33.280]   So those of you who are not doing well,
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:35.120]   by the grace of God, participate.
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:37.560]   For those of you who are filled with pride,
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:38.440]   thinking that you're gonna come here
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.180]   because you've been good, to be humbled
[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:43.880]   when you come to the communion table.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.960]   And for all of us to eagerly anticipate,

[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:55.640]   This is temporary, our eternity is coming,
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:58.960]   and we're gonna be at the wedding together with Christ.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.480]   So this morning, as we participate in the communion table,
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.320]   we're gonna ask the praise team to come up,
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:06.160]   we're gonna sing the communion song together,
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.680]   and then after that, I will open up the communion with us,
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:13.240]   and then we'll do it at once together, okay?

[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:50.680]   - So if you can take your communion cup and the bread,
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:52.360]   again, those of you who haven't done this before,
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:56.520]   there's a thin layer of plastic that you need to take.
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:59.160]   And then the second part, you open that up.
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:04.960]   So as you hold onto this,
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:08.480]   let me read the passage in 1 Corinthians 11, 23.
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.960]   It says, "For I received from the Lord
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:11.280]   that which I also received,
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.740]   we deliver to you that the Lord Jesus in the night
[01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:16.860]   in which he was betrayed took bread.
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:18.600]   When he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:20.280]   "This is my body, which is for you.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:23.040]   Do this in remembrance of me."
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.320]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper,
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:28.280]   saying, "This cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:31.760]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.040]   For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:38.480]   you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes."
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:39.980]   So let's participate together.
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:31:04.980]  , anyone else stand up for the closing praise?
