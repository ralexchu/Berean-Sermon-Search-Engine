[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   - Hello, everyone.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.280]   Welcome to another session of our Ephesians Bible study.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.520]   Let's take a moment to go before the Lord.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.160]   Pray for His blessing as we jump into the text.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.160]   Let's pray.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.760]   God, we thank you for your grace.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.280]   Lord, we think about all the various difficult things that we must do in our lives.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.360]   We think about all the various things you have blessed us with, especially our families.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.640]   And we pray, Father, that we would hold those gifts and blessings with great thankfulness,
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.200]   but also a weightiness of responsibility.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.160]   And God, as you challenge us to be more like you, to be like Christ in the home, I pray,
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.320]   Father, that we would be all the more inspired by your word and instruction, that we would
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.000]   be inspired by your spirit, that God, ultimately, it would be to your glory and good pleasure
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.440]   to see your children, Lord, build and continue to love as you do.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.480]   Lord, we thank you again for your instruction.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.520]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.520]   Amen.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.520]   Okay.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.600]   Well, let's jump right in and read our passage.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.800]   I'm gonna start from verse 21 and make our way down to verse 33.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.960]   And the passage says, "And be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.920]   Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.080]   For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, he
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.400]   himself being the savior of the body.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.120]   But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.120]   in everything."
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.480]   Husbands, love your wives as, just as Christ also loved the church and gave
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.840]   himself up for her, so that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.320]   water with the word, that he might present to himself the church in all her glory, having
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.800]   no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she would be holy and blameless.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.720]   So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.840]   He who loves his own wife loves himself, for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.920]   and cherishes it just as Christ also does the church, because we are members of his
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.480]   body.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.960]   For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife,
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.000]   and the two shall become one flesh.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.320]   This mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.800]   Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.960]   the wife must see to it that she respects her husband.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.080]   Again, we just always try to typically do a quick review and connection that when you
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.520]   think about submission, you are placing yourself under, right?
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.780]   And what you realize is there is a regular pattern in our lives as Christians to diminish
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.320]   our own significance.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.600]   And the scriptures literally tell us in other passages to regard others as much more important
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.960]   than yourself.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.920]   And the needs of others in greater priority than yourself.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.320]   But within that also, in the home, God has designed it that there be levels of leadership
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.160]   and submission within the home.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.080]   And what we realize from the previous passage is that the role that God has for the husband
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.840]   is that he should reflect Christ's headship over the church.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.780]   And so if we're trying to think of conceptually, how do I envision the role of the husband,
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.920]   you should be meditating about what does it mean for Christ to be head, right?
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.640]   What does it mean for the husband to be head of the house?
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.440]   And all those different things, because obviously one paragraph isn't going to give you every
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.120]   element of what that role entails.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.240]   But what we realize is when we get a big vision and a picture of what we are supposed to be,
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.640]   then all the little steps then we can think about and apply.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.480]   So the idea here is that the husbands have an incredibly great role to play when it comes
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.200]   to leadership as a husband and as father.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.280]   Now what's kind of funny is when I think about the role of husband and the role of wife,
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.400]   I think about some of the weddings that I've been to and the interesting and fun, cliche-ish
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.640]   things that people say.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.440]   I've heard it said, you know, a husband say, "Happy wife, happy life," right?
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.920]   Now all of that is just a little bit of just, I guess you could say idioms that we say for
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.100]   fun.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.600]   And another thing that I've heard at weddings is there are three rings in marriage, engagement
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.120]   ring, wedding ring, and suffering.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.920]   And it's like, "Ha ha," and everybody laughs.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.800]   And it's been a little bit overplayed, so people don't say it anymore.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.140]   When it comes to even the husband's role and the wife's role, I heard somebody say within
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.240]   a wedding context that the husband is the head, but I am the neck that turns the head.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.520]   And everyone, "Ha ha," you know, it's pretty funny.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.480]   Well, when I think about that, obviously it's funny because there's an element of the human
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.640]   observation of life and says, "Yeah, these are kind of funny.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.160]   I know they're not like life rules to live by, but they're just funny observations about
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.980]   our relationship."
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.720]   And there's another one I want to add to this because today I just want to summarize.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.560]   There's this little teaching and rhyme I want to say.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.920]   I made this up myself, okay?
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.840]   He who has no head is dead.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   Okay?
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.600]   Now, what I mean by that is this.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:44.800]   I realize within this passage, there's going to be such a significance.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:52.480]   We can't say enough about how important it is that there be strong leadership.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.040]   Again, we talked about every institution of man, there is some kind of leadership and
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.600]   there's authority and there is subjection.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.800]   Well, when you think about the importance of leadership, one of the things that I mentioned
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.640]   was whether it's a dance class, whether it's a sport and you have a coach, one of the major
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:18.120]   factors that makes it so fun and one of the major factors that makes it so enjoyable and
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:25.480]   one of the factors that actually makes the team or the organization work is to make sure
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.520]   that there's strong leadership because where there is no leadership, there's going to be
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.360]   a massive contributor to all the wrongs that we see in any kind of institution and even
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.440]   society at large.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.520]   So I can't emphasize enough how important strong leadership is.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.080]   And so when I think about that, actually, one of the greatest challenges that I think
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.720]   every young man needs to hear is that at some point or another, we need to get ourselves
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.440]   ready to adopt and accept that role.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.720]   There is a temptation to not want that kind of responsibility on our shoulders.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.040]   There's a temptation to expect other people to lead you.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.200]   There are some people who want basically in the home, the other party to do their fair
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.840]   share of decision making and just make sure that no other extra burden comes on me.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.640]   And I think that kind of mentality is all wrong.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:29.320]   There is this attitude that needs to be garnered, which is to say not in a prideful way, but
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.240]   if God has so designed me to take upon this role, even if my personality doesn't lend
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.520]   to strong leadership, or even if my life experiences doesn't naturally guide me to be a strong
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.560]   leader in the home, nevertheless, so be it.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.800]   That's something I have to submit to.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:55.680]   That God has called for the husbands in the home to be example setting, role playing leaders
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:02.800]   who has been given a title by Christ, an incredibly serious title to say, "You are to reflect
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.520]   my headship over the church in your home."
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.120]   And I have both given you then the proper example, which is Christ himself, the proper
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.760]   resources, which is the scriptures and the spirit.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.000]   And I've also given the commandment to those who are underneath your leadership to submit
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   to you.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Wow.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.560]   I have to then as a first step say, "Okay, although I am super fallible, although I am
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:33.640]   deficient in so many ways, this is a specific calling that God has given to me."
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.360]   That's the way we need to think of it.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.720]   Now, as we continue to meditate and ask the question then about what does headship over
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.600]   the church, what does headship over the wife, what does that mean for the husband?
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:52.720]   We learned that Christ calls the husband to love like Jesus loves.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.560]   God desires us to love like Christ loves.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.560]   And he says, "Husbands, love your wives just as Christ also loved the church and gave himself
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.400]   up for her."
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.880]   And the commandment is very simple that we need to be lovers.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:14.280]   And just as a immediate kind of meditation and thinking about that, I recognize the fact
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:20.520]   that yes, I think what's more natural to a lot of men is we are naturally workers.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.940]   We are naturally task oriented.
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:30.000]   We are kind of naturally bent on having certain, maybe just thinking like engineers or something
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.680]   like that to take a problem and fix it or whatever it may be.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.440]   But when it comes to relational love, that's an area that perhaps doesn't come as naturally.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.360]   Nevertheless, that's a calling for us.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:47.760]   And this is in such massive contrast to what has been then in the history of mankind, right?
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:54.240]   Last week we described how yes, it is a difficult thing that in terms of history, we acknowledge
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.480]   the fact that throughout history, women have been mistreated.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:04.880]   There have been sinful men who have viewed women more so like property throughout history.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.920]   And the thing about it is the whole shebang of the concept of what authority means, right?
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.880]   What that should look like has been misconstrued by man without God.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:20.080]   Within God's understanding of authority, that authority is used to love.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:27.100]   That leadership is more so described and depicted as somebody who knows how to love much.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:33.080]   And it's in contrast to I think today's day, today's concept of what marriage should be.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.440]   Because in today's eyes, marriage should be fulfilling.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.840]   And so there are those who are so disappointed with marriage, they'll say certain statements
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.840]   like, "You know what?
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.900]   This marriage thing, it just failed to meet my needs."
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:50.700]   And what I say again is we are looking at that picture the wrong way.
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.920]   Think about team leaders of a project.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.840]   You know, I know we're supposed to be doing this project for our work, but man, my team
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.560]   just doesn't fill my needs.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.200]   But you're the team leader.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.320]   I mean, think about it.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.240]   If you were a school teacher, right?
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.720]   You're a biology teacher.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.680]   You go into class, you come out and you say, "You know what?
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.440]   This class is horrible because this class does not fill my needs."
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.040]   But you're the teacher, right?
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:21.200]   Do you see how this, just this command of loving the wives and exercising headship over
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:29.560]   that home and exercising headship in relation to the wife, it has within a worldview which
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.080]   is totally unlike the world.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.480]   And what's crazy about all this is the manner and the model by which Christ gave this commandment
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   is to say that we need to love the church as He did and gave Himself up for her.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.860]   You know, last week I asked an interesting question, which was, "Who do you think has
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:46.860]   it harder?
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.760]   Who has a tougher responsibility and a tougher job?
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.320]   Do ladies or do the men?"
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.120]   And I will concede that it is arguably the sisters.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.200]   Why?
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.680]   Because you have to submit to sinners.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.380]   You have to follow fallible examples.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:08.040]   You're just following a shadow of the actual reality, right?
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.280]   We said it's very difficult and last week we didn't get to talk about what are some
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.920]   different circumstances, exceptions, are there any?
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.280]   We didn't get to talk about all those kind of things, but we recognize the fact that
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:25.240]   the responsibility to submit to a, yes, redeemed Christian man, but still in his flesh, is
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.680]   a tall, tall order.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.680]   But here, and arguably, again, the correct answer to that original question is, "Man,
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.000]   you could, it's tough to say."
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.800]   But arguably, let's meditate and think about this command to love like Christ and to love
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.200]   sacrificially.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.440]   You think about the model of Christ in his incredible, lavishing, humble love.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:54.160]   I mean, just take a scroll back in Ephesians and think about chapter one and two.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.120]   You think about Christ's love.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.880]   It was so intentional, so purposeful.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:07.040]   You know, one of the things that never ceases to amaze me is to dwell and meditate on this
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.760]   fact.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:16.760]   That the idea of loving us did not originate with my nagging and with my pleas and with
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.240]   my cries for help.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.680]   Right?
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:27.080]   Like God's design to love, his desire to redeem wasn't because he heard us like, "What
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.080]   was that?
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.200]   Oh, my people are in need."
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.040]   Like that's not the story, is it?
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:39.280]   The fact of the matter is we were so entrenched in our wretchedness and we were so entrenched
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.120]   in our pride that sinful man wouldn't even cry out for help.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.000]   I mean, just take a moment to think about that.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.440]   I think about this sometimes.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:53.920]   My soul, because of the stain of sin, resists to repent even last week if I sinned.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:00.040]   To think that it was our cry for help that caused Christ to come down, that's not reality.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:06.120]   But the truth of the matter is, in these realities, Christ took the first step.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.120]   He loved first.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.200]   He initiated and from his own accord, he loved us.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.440]   There was nobody kicking him under the table, nobody giving him reminders.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.120]   It was him.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.200]   And what's more, this passage is very clear.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:27.240]   The aspect of his love that is incredibly profound is his willingness to self-sacrifice
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.920]   and lay down his life.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:38.080]   The wife could look at the husband and say, "Wow, you really need to learn how to die."
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:44.560]   The calling for the husband is to die to self, to lay down personal preferences, rights,
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:50.400]   to lay down personal priorities so that he might love his wife sacrificially as Christ
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.400]   did.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.800]   That he might give freely, willingly, and graciously as an encouragement to the single
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.160]   guys who aren't husbands yet.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:07.080]   There are ways to build up our character because essentially that element in us, a loving heart
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.320]   that is willing to sacrifice will build character.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:18.360]   Think about how you can develop a heart that sees needs and takes the first step.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.440]   Think about how you can be observant to not just simply yourself and your wellbeing, but
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.880]   the wellbeing of the people around you and actually say, "Let me do that."
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.200]   I want to tell you a funny story.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.600]   I used to do welcoming team for a long time.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.600]   I did it all through my college years here at Berean.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.840]   I loved it.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.360]   One of the things was just that challenge.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:44.200]   As a welcoming team member, you're not just the person who passes a program.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:49.000]   You're supposed to see people as they come in and be an incredible host.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.200]   I remember taking upon that challenge.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.260]   We had some amazing welcome team members through the years and so thankful for them.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.960]   Back then we used to do lunch things.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.720]   Back then we used to do a lot of stuff at church.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.840]   People would be carrying their supplies.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.640]   The education department, they would always carry the boxes because we were out of school.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.440]   One time I was like, "I should help," so I ran over.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.200]   I said, "Let me get that."
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   They were so thankful.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.520]   The part of me was like, "Oh, I feel so good about helping."
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.440]   Then there was this other moment when there was a much older sister at church.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.840]   She was carrying this heavy bag.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.840]   I ran over.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.440]   I was like, "Let me get that for you," but I said it as I was a machismo guy.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.440]   She was like, "Oh, I get it.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.440]   Moon's like a man now, huh?"
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.440]   I was like, "Oh."
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.160]   I didn't know how to respond to that.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.640]   Ladies, if a guy tries to help out, just let him do it.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.920]   I saw a little bit of pride there.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.360]   That's for another sermon.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.280]   But the idea is that just kind of shook me.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.840]   I was like, "I don't know what to do now.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.840]   Am I being prideful?
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.240]   Am I being helpful?"
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:49.880]   The idea is it's better to lean for guys on the side of taking initiative.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.760]   Are you going to look a little cocky, a little bit like, "Oh, okay, maybe."
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.640]   That's better than looking ignorant.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.360]   It's better than looking like you have no sight.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.400]   You're not observant.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.640]   You don't care about other people.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.640]   If you're so afraid, like, "I don't want to infringe.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.640]   Can I help you?
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.640]   Can I not?"
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.520]   Then just ask the question, "Can I help you?
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.900]   Is it okay if I do that for you?"
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.480]   Whatever it may be, but take that lead.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.400]   I think that's important for us to learn.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.900]   Again, for me, I'm an incredibly passive guy by nature.
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:23.900]   This is something for me, I just like regularly trying to remind myself, "God desires for
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:28.220]   you to be like Him, and so we must."
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:36.700]   Now, so we see then this calling to love like Christ and it moves forward into other elements
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.620]   of Christ's love.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.820]   Notice that here it's still describing Christ's love.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.180]   I want to make that a point here.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:49.660]   The rest of the passage, as it describes the love that a husband should show to the wife,
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:54.060]   the whole time he's actually describing Christ's love at the majority of it.
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.380]   So here, even though he's talking about the sanctifying, cleansing, all that kind of stuff,
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:03.100]   you can really clearly tell he's more so talking about Christ's love for the church.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:08.100]   But moving forward, notice I highlighted for you these terms.
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:14.240]   It is so that, and then verse 27, that, and then right in the middle of it, but that.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:23.900]   And all of those prepositions, excuse me, all of those prepositions help us to understand
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.580]   that there is a purpose behind Christ's love.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:33.080]   God's love is purposeful and therefore you must love with purpose.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:39.540]   He says that His purpose is to sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.500]   with the word.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:48.140]   His purpose is to sacrificially love for the good of the church, that the church would
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.380]   be holy.
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.300]   Think about that.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:19:01.980]   His desire is to cleanse her of all unrighteousness, to cause the church to live in greater accordance
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.180]   to the high standard of God's word.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.040]   Take a moment to think about that.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.680]   You know, sometimes I counsel people and husbands, wives, it goes both ways.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.040]   They start complaining about each other of how ungodly they are.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.040]   I got duped.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.720]   What do you mean you got duped?
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.720]   I thought they were so godly.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.320]   Start living with them and next thing you know, they're lazy.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.680]   Sometimes they're so passive.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.240]   Sometimes they don't care.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.400]   Sometimes they don't pray.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.000]   Sometimes they don't, da da da da, and they're not careful with their words.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.120]   And you just realize people are so much more sinful than you presume, you know?
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.160]   And then when you think about that, I want you to understand, well, it comes back to
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.300]   this idea.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:51.880]   Is Christ complaining about how sinful his church is, his bride is?
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:59.080]   Or is he being the man and taking upon that responsibility to wash her?
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.600]   Wow.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:08.520]   He is going to be the greatest agent of cleansing in her life by inspiring and teaching the
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.760]   knowledge of the scriptures and the application of the scriptures.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:18.480]   So whose responsibility is it now that you see either laziness in your spouse?
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:24.480]   Whose responsibility is it now when you see that ungodliness of their words in your spouse?
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.720]   And the thing about it is good leaders.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.720]   Good leaders are not going to be just okay with ungodliness.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.000]   And I think this is something that is important, right?
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.600]   Husbands has to have a level of working knowledge of the scriptures that they're able to see
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:46.160]   not because of personal irritation, but because of the standard of God, that's not holy.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.840]   And not because of what it does to me, but more so because of what it does in relationship
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.600]   to God, you need to grow in this area.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.200]   That takes strength and courage because some people will say, "Well, I don't want to say
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.240]   anything because man, happy wife is happy life."
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.880]   Uh-uh.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.360]   Then all of a sudden you concede your leadership.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.480]   That's something that again is a huge challenge.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.320]   That's something is such a huge challenge.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.320]   Why?
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:18.120]   Because I would say 95% of people do not want to get into conflict.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.200]   But the husband should not get into conflict for his own preferences.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.120]   He should get into conflict for the standard of God.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.240]   Why?
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.440]   Why?
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:33.960]   Because look at this verse 27, "That he might present to himself the church in all her glory,
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:40.040]   having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she would be holy and blameless."
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.280]   Here is this strange turn of events.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.560]   Some husbands thought, "Wait a minute.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:51.480]   I thought my wife was supposed to be, I thought my wife was supposed to be a help meat."
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.480]   If you're conservative churches and you learned about husband and wife roles, they've learned
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.480]   that term.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.760]   You're the one that comes along and you're supposed to support the husband in my endeavor
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:07.720]   to be a successful, I don't know, career guy, whatever it may be, a successful lawyer, successful
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.520]   policeman, successful educator, whatever it may be.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.360]   I need to make sure that I'm doing that well.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.720]   I need to be successful and you're supposed to come around and help me.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.520]   You're supposed to be help meat.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.160]   But then this picture is like all the way around, like I'm supposed to be almost supporting
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:29.720]   you to be the best that God desires you to be, for you to be holy, for you to be growing.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.120]   Is that the way it is now?
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:38.960]   It is interesting because clearly I think what this challenges us to think about is,
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:44.080]   yes, the scripture already commanded the wife to submit to the husband, but the husband's
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:51.360]   desire is for the good of the wife and in that way, her well-being, her godliness, her
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:58.000]   holiness, he is serving that purpose and in that way he's subjecting.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.240]   But you know what's really interesting, the way I want to put it, is that Christ has a
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.760]   glorious vision for his bride.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.000]   And so husbands, let me ask you, those of you who are watching for husbands, do you
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.680]   have a glorious vision for your wife?
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.680]   Think about all this.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.240]   He wants to present her in all her glory.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.120]   When was the last time we thought that?
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:32.520]   I want to see in my vision of my wife is to picture her in all her glory, that there would
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.280]   not even be a spot or wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.040]   And yes, when I was studying this passage, I was like, "Ooh, we can break this down.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.480]   What does it mean to have no spot, no wrinkle or any such thing?"
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.920]   And then I laughed because my mind is really simple.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:49.920]   It's like, "Maybe I should buy her that skin cream, make her glow to address those sun
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.920]   spots.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.800]   She spent too much time in the sun playing sports or something like that."
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.800]   Okay, if you want to do that, do it.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.360]   At least bare minimum, you got that application down.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:03.320]   But obviously it's talking about so much more.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.880]   And I apologize for using this example, but I feel like maybe some guys might be like,
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.200]   "Oh, I don't know I'm supposed to do this."
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.680]   But we do.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.920]   Why?
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.200]   Because there are guys who have project cars.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.160]   They have project this, project that, project this and project that.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.240]   And we know what it means to get something and take it with all of its imperfections
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:29.720]   and then start buffing things out and putting your elbow grease and sweat, waxing the car,
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.360]   putting protection over it, vacuuming the insides.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.400]   And we do details, detail-oriented things, dusters and all that kind of stuff.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.560]   We do ceramic coating.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.560]   We do all this sort of stuff.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.000]   And then we use different products.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   We know.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.280]   We don't even need our friends to be around.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.840]   Sometimes after you do that work, you invest, you take a step back and you watch your project
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.840]   shine.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:56.360]   And it gives you pleasure because you've invested yourself in there.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:01.960]   There are times when I counsel couples and all the wife desires is to receive that kind
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.840]   of investment, personal attention from the wife.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.720]   And yeah, we, husbands may have reasons.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.360]   Oh gosh, you know, like we got busy, we had kids, all that stuff.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.440]   But that's where we need to learn and grow.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:24.120]   Husbands need to learn to have this glorious vision for the one that they love and be able
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:29.880]   to give that kind of personal investment, to show affection, to show care, to be able
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:35.280]   to see where are the areas that my wife needs that support.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:42.080]   So husbands, again, you got this desire to see no spring, no wrinkle, no spot, no such
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.200]   thing that she would be blameless.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.720]   And man, what a high calling that would be.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.840]   Because now, you know, husbands feel like sometimes men feel like, okay, I'm going to,
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.400]   I'm going to train her.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.880]   And it didn't say train your wife.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.880]   Okay.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.160]   Let's just make that very clear.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:02.160]   It didn't say go, you know, like train and whip them into shape.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.400]   That is not what it said.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.440]   Scripture many times talks about showing an instruction and giving guidance and stuff
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.440]   like that.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:15.440]   And many times it's not so much manipulation or force, but it's inspiration through example.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:21.360]   You now have to think about how are you going to lead to this end goal of spiritually providing
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.360]   for her.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:28.360]   For the spiritual provision as God, I mean, think about God, like God desiring to take
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.600]   care of his people.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.280]   He wants you to be that pocket small group leader, so to speak in your home.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.920]   And you supposed to be that example setting individual who is loving the word, lead by
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:44.400]   example to cherish scripture, to apply, lead by example of how you're going to deal with
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.560]   fatigue.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.040]   You lead by example of how are you going to use your spare time?
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.840]   You lead by example of how are you going to deal with that stress, the stress upon you
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.480]   at work, you're going to come home and take it all out.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:02.240]   You lead by example of how are you going to absorb the hits of life and not retaliate.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.240]   You lead by example.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.200]   I know some of us, man, we struggle with the thoughts of like, how am I going to provide
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.760]   for my wife?
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:15.000]   This here in terms of providing that spiritual personal investment, that should be at the
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.200]   top of our list.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:24.240]   So we've learned that much that our love should be sanctifying and glorifying as husbands.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:30.760]   But next, the passage challenges us to love like you love yourself.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.680]   Love like you love yourself.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:39.080]   Verse 28 says, "So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies."
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:45.700]   Now, so again, sometimes I sit and I just like, as I'm writing, I typically just break
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.320]   down a verse and just start writing all my thoughts about it in each little section.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.520]   Part of me, I was like, well, truth be told, my body's clearly not being taken care of
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.520]   right now.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:01.040]   Like I'm starting to develop a gut, I've got bad posture, I'm complaining about my bad
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.040]   back.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:07.600]   Okay, you can't give an excuse like, well, you know, I just don't care too much.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.680]   No, no, no.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.640]   There is what you call an assumption of the norm here, an assumption of the norm.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.600]   What is the assumption of the norm?
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.900]   The assumption of the norm is that we love ourselves.
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:25.460]   The assumption of the norm is that in terms of who you're taking care of best, the majority
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:30.900]   of individuals take care of their own bodies much, much better than anybody else.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.900]   So husbands, think about this.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.100]   How would you immediately apply this?
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:41.500]   If you are to love your wives as yourself, what are you supposed to be doing?
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.300]   Now sometimes guys, I think a lot of guys, the way they think about love is like, well,
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.780]   I buy myself a ton of toys, I'm going to buy my wife a toy, right?
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.920]   Now if that's your application, again, very simplistic.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.160]   If that's your application, do it because at least you're doing something.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:01.140]   But scripture typically calls us to so much more than buying a wife toys.
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.320]   What is the principle here?
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.740]   Think about this principle and the rest of the passage, starting from verse 30.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:13.980]   In Ephesians chapter five, verse 30, the scripture says that we need to love our own wives.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:19.420]   There is this possessive, me and her are like, there's a possession there.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.380]   Like wives, your husband's yours and nobody else's.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.900]   Husbands, your wife is yours and nobody else's.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:32.980]   There is an exclusive, confined, covenantal love that guards you, the two of you.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.980]   But the scripture says more than that.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.700]   Explanation is because we are members of his body.
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:45.180]   For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:48.180]   and the two shall become one.
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:54.260]   This mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.060]   What is he highlighting when he says, love your wives as your own body?
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.800]   He's highlighting the spiritual truth that yes, you are two separate individuals coming
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.540]   together in the holy matrimony of marriage, but there is a spiritual reality greater than
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.020]   two people living in the same house.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.140]   You are one body.
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.020]   You're spiritually one.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.900]   That's the way he describes it.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:22.380]   And it's from the beginning, the way that God has fashioned husband and wife is like
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.380]   this.
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:29.460]   The principle is the Lord God fashioned into a woman, the rib, sorry, the Lord God fashioned
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:34.260]   into a woman, the rib, which he had taken from the man and brought her to the man.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:39.780]   The man said, this is now bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh.
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:44.180]   She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man.
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:49.340]   For this reason, a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife and
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:52.020]   they shall become one flesh.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:56.140]   And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:01.820]   I mean, wow, we could actually camp out there and think like, whoa, if you think about this,
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.860]   just recall we originated essentially.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:09.980]   And if you look at other passages, for example, first Corinthians chapter 11, it talks about
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:17.140]   how, listen, two are different and yes, there's authority, but within this man comes from
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:21.100]   the wife, but what's more, the wife came from the husband.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:26.940]   So when you think about it, there is this identity where you're bound together as one.
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:30.580]   And I think we as husbands have to keep thinking on that level.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:34.900]   We are by nature and identity completely different once you're married.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.060]   And you have to think like that.
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:41.060]   You have to think about yourselves as one being.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.380]   You can't constantly think about it like, well, she's different.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.940]   Well, she has different ideas.
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.020]   Well, she's this and she's that.
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:53.240]   We have to understand that we are in this desire to get married.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.120]   We are moving towards oneness.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.220]   We are moving towards unity.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.820]   And I think when you take a look at husbands and wives who have been together for a long,
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:07.860]   long time, and they've really tried, they've really tried to submit oneself to another
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:13.380]   and to work together, there is a kind of mutual understanding and intimacy that's just like
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.940]   a treasure, right?
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.380]   It's rare.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.280]   You know it's a fruit of like long-term investment.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:25.260]   And that is not something that is just so commonplace.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:31.260]   What's the other thing about this is, again, there is an assumption.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:34.980]   And here's the assumption.
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:41.980]   Verse 29, "For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.020]   also does the church."
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.260]   So you see that?
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.020]   The idea here is there is an assumption.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.900]   There is nobody who hates themselves.
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:56.300]   I'm going to take a quick line from one of my counseling professors.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.780]   He says, "You know, honestly speaking, someone may disagree with me.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:00.780]   It's like, I hate myself.
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.540]   And there are people who hurt themselves.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.980]   There are people who despise themselves, so to speak.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.900]   And they'll say, no, I hate myself."
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:13.700]   But a professor used to say, "Well, I disagree, number one, because scripture says typically,
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.180]   no, you don't really hate yourself.
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:18.220]   And if you do hate yourself, it's kind of a perverted hate."
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.460]   What he means by this is, he said, "There was a time when he was counseling somebody
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:28.140]   and that person was somebody at the school that he was already ministering at.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.060]   And then that individual wrestled deeply with saying, I hate myself.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.460]   I just radically hate myself.
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.100]   And he took notes down and he said, okay, I'm going to have to think about this and
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.100]   come back."
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.460]   But what he recognized was that when they went out to lunch, that individual was at
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.460]   the salad bar and they were sitting there picking the best tomatoes.
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:48.620]   And then he realized, I don't know if you really hate yourself, right?
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:53.140]   Because the idea is you don't stand in a buffet line picking the best tomatoes for yourself
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.460]   when you actually hate yourself.
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:58.820]   Because if you did truly hate yourself, you would just go ahead and eat dirt, right?
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:03.700]   But no, you feed yourself sushi, you feed yourself on buffets, and then you say, I hate
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.060]   myself.
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:12.380]   The idea here is this, the assumption, the assumption is that we already have such a
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:17.420]   vested interest on our self-preservation and our glory.
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:22.580]   And when we disappoint our own vested interest, that's when we are disappointed in ourselves.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.820]   Now why am I talking about this?
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:28.660]   Because foolishly, this generation had this weird thought that if you are to really, really
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:33.140]   love your wife, then you need to first be happy in your own skin.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:38.220]   Better yet, you need to love yourself in order to love the other person.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:41.020]   That's just kind of backwards thinking.
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.980]   It's kind of one of those, oh, pretty cool to put on the Facebook and, you know, oh,
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:46.860]   that might sound really profound.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.940]   But actually it's not.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:53.940]   When he says you need to love yourself, sorry, you need to love your wife as yourself, the
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:57.980]   assumption is you already nourish your own body.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.580]   Look at this.
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:05.220]   He says, you already nourish and you cherish your body.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.500]   It's yours, so you take care of it.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.760]   That's the assumption.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:14.620]   And so likewise, you husbands, you need to learn how to nourish and cherish your wives.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.620]   Really briefly, what does it mean to nourish?
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:22.820]   There's a lot to say about this, but just really briefly, to nourish has this intensity
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.620]   to it because it's a combo word.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.620]   It's ek trefo.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.620]   Okay.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:32.100]   It's an ek is the intensive part and a trefo means to nurture, to feed, to rear, to bring
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:36.260]   up to maturity, such as in the case of children.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.300]   Uh-oh, are you supposed to baby your wife?
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.940]   No, you're not supposed to baby your wife.
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.580]   But surely you're supposed to nourish her just like you would nourish yourself.
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.300]   What's more, the passage says to cherish.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.340]   And you know what's really interesting?
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:55.180]   Cherish has a literal sense where if you're using it technically, it literally means to
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.900]   warm.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.100]   So the next time your wife talks about how cold it is, but you're like, oh my goodness,
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.380]   but I'm sweaty and hot.
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.020]   You need to warm your, I'm just kidding.
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.020]   I'm just kidding.
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:10.140]   Figuratively, the idea is to cherish and the passage where it's used is 1 Thessalonians
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:17.100]   chapter two, it says, but we prove to be gentle among you and a nursing mother tend as a nursing
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.660]   mother who tenderly cares for her own children.
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:27.460]   Interestingly enough, there's a term here, tenderly cares means to cherish.
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.740]   I want you to think about that.
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:32.860]   You know, I think again, one of the dangers of being in a love relationship where you
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:38.020]   see each other every single day from, you know, sunup to sundown and you go home is
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:44.500]   you see all the things and you're so tempted to judge the other person like, oh, oh, right.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.740]   You get all irritated and you get all disappointed.
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:52.140]   But the thing about it is we don't do that with our kids because our kids, they're selfish.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.140]   They're rowdy.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.140]   They don't listen.
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.140]   They're rebellious.
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.140]   They're arrogant.
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.140]   Oh goodness.
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.140]   You know, sometimes they get arrogant.
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:02.820]   Sometimes they say things in ignorance, but you don't sit there like, oh, you arrogant
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.720]   synth like, right.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.060]   You still love and cherish.
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.060]   Why?
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.060]   That's your baby, right?
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:14.100]   That's, that's your pride and joy.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:18.300]   Husbands need to learn to do that with the adult wife you have.
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:23.980]   Not in any kind of condescending, patronizing, chauvinistic way.
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:29.780]   Not to demean people like children, but the fact of the matter is this element I feel
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:33.300]   like I, you know, just again, such a challenge.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.900]   How do we as husband, as men learn to cherish people?
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.940]   And I realized some of the people that I, that I respect most, sometimes they're like
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:45.060]   really like they're a man's man, you know, like they wear the same jeans.
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.060]   They only have one color t-shirt.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:50.540]   They're just like simple men who are not afraid to do anything.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.740]   So just like, we need to take care of this.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.740]   Okay.
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:54.820]   If I can do it, if I did it wrong, that's fine.
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.940]   I can be humble and say I did it wrong, but let's do it right.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:01.700]   Like they've got that, that kind of male courage.
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:07.660]   Sometimes I see how soft and tender their heart is where there's loyalty, where they,
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:13.260]   they feel that association with somebody and they cling to people because they love them.
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:19.780]   And sometimes I realize like, oh man, as a young man, I need to learn how to do this,
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.420]   to cherish somebody.
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:27.180]   I think for me, I have learned over the years to detach myself very quickly.
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.540]   Out of sight, out of mind.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:29.540]   Right.
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:33.820]   So I kind of envy people who have friends from high school and college years.
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:37.500]   If you're not at my church, I don't have, honestly speaking.
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:38.500]   Right.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.820]   The fact of the matter is though, if we are to be more like Christ, we should have this
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:52.820]   huge heart that is capable of being turned to like a mushy mother, right?
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:57.540]   Mushy father to care and love for the person who is closest to you.
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:03.540]   And yet a lot of times when I counsel, I find that rather than this loyalty and this cherishing,
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.700]   sometimes we have the harshest criticisms.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.800]   The most, right?
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.900]   Like rather than the most detailed care and I want to present you wholly, it's like I
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.500]   have the most detailed judgment and record of your wrong.
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:18.500]   Right.
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:23.980]   And then I realized, oh, we are very far from the expectations of God.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:29.860]   My conclusion, Paul says, "Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.140]   wife even as himself.
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:36.740]   And the wife must see to it that she respects her husband."
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.500]   When I think about this, I think about this idea.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.300]   He kind of sums up and says, "Nevertheless," right?
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.940]   Like, so you're supposed to do all this.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.500]   You're supposed to see the other person like your own body.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.940]   You're supposed to sacrifice.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.660]   You're supposed to have a vision for her glory.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.460]   They're supposed to have a vision for her sanctification and blamelessness.
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:40:00.220]   And in all this, you're supposed to love his own wife even as himself.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:05.940]   And so he brings it in and into that circle again of saying, the kind of love you are,
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:13.660]   that we have in marriage is a very unique, intimate kind of exclusive love, protected
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:17.620]   by God's own design.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:25.420]   And so as a challenge, again, may we all desire to really just kind of rise from whatever
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.940]   we feel is like, "Oh, understandable.
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:31.460]   Understandably, we always have this and fights and disagreements and blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.460]   blah, right?
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.580]   And understandably, you know, wives and husbands, they're going to have a hard time.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.340]   And understandably, we don't understand each other.
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.300]   And understandably, we do this and that kind of stuff."
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.980]   Sure, we live in the flesh.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:46.140]   But man, this picture that God has given for the love, let's make sure that we have that
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.700]   vision in our hearts.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:52.660]   I want to conclude by this challenge from 1 Peter 3 that says, "You husbands in the
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:57.940]   same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker since she is a
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:07.220]   woman and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.900]   will not be hindered.
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:17.340]   If you neglect this portion of your role as a husband to your wife, your prayers will
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.340]   be hindered.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:24.900]   What's more, to sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:31.500]   in spirit, not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:36.620]   For you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing."
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.780]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:48.900]   Lord God, you have set a glorious example by loving first.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.540]   For that, we can do nothing but thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:57.580]   But also we do want to say, God, we long to be more like you.
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:58.780]   You are lovely, Lord.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.060]   You are holy and pure.
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.980]   And we want to be more like you.
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:07.540]   And then truthfully speaking, Lord, if we took a moment to do a thorough evaluation,
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:12.660]   oh goodness, God, we would fail in so many ways.
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:18.220]   But Father God, help us not to simply be discouraged by our failures, but all the more be inspired
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.000]   that God, we have much to learn.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.340]   We have so much opportunity to love in greater fashion.
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:30.180]   We have so much opportunity to minister to our families.
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:34.220]   And I pray, Father God, that you would strengthen us by your spirit to do that.
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:41.020]   Lord, I presume, Father God, that sometimes some of the most difficult scenarios of life
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.500]   happen in scenarios found in the home.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:49.100]   And Father, we recognize that it is a weighty blessing you have given to us.
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:53.180]   And because of that, Lord, sometimes when things go wrong, the pain and the heartache
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.180]   is deep.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:43:00.340]   But I pray, Father God, that rather than being jaded, you'd grant to us a desire to apply
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.980]   your word.
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:06.820]   And especially strengthen all the fathers and all the husbands in the home.
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:11.660]   God, that you'd grant to them not the strength of the world, not the strength of their flesh,
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:17.700]   but true spiritual vision and strength of faith that God, you have called us to emulate
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.780]   Christ in this life.
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.940]   So Father, would you to that end, guide us and lead us.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.380]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:34.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
