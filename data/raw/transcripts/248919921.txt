[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.040]   We're going to finish up what we started last week, Romans 12, verses 3-8.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.400]   For by the grace given to me, I say to everyone among you, not to think of himself more highly
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.720]   than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.000]   of faith that God has assigned.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.680]   For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.440]   So we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.800]   Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them, if prophecy
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.800]   in proportion to our faith, if service in our serving, the one who teaches in his teaching,
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.680]   the one who exhorts in his exhortation, the one who contributes in generosity, the one
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.680]   who leads with zeal, and the one who does acts of mercy with cheerfulness.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.480]   Let's pray.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.760]   Gracious and loving Father, we want to thank you.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.480]   We thank you for the brothers and sisters that you've placed around us to love, to serve,
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.200]   to give, to run this race together.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.280]   Open our eyes to see your grace and your gift, not only of salvation, but the various gifts
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.480]   that you've given throughout the church, Lord God, that we may use it to worship you, to
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.020]   honor you, to glorify and build up the church together.
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.640]   We pray for wisdom.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.080]   We pray for open ears, softened hearts, that your word would have its effect on us.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.600]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.500]   Alright, so last week we were going over the three essential qualities of what brings the
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.240]   church together.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.880]   We call it the BALT, and the first part of it is our unity in Christ is first and foremost
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.680]   based upon our belief that Christ is the head of the church.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.160]   And so our unity is not uniformity where we just kind of look like each other, we sound
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.240]   like each other, and we do certain things similar.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.720]   And so we're not bound together superficially, but what ultimately binds us together is our
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.720]   commitment to Christ.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.720]   And again, the beauty of the church is we have people from all walks of life, different
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.320]   backgrounds, different ages, that we share the common faith in Christ, which binds us.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.700]   That's the B part of it, the belief.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.960]   And as a result of that, it's given that we understand that if we are the body of Christ
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.840]   and God created us to be interconnected, that there would be practice of love.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.840]   That Jesus said that the greatest quality of his disciples ought to be the love that
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.200]   he practiced on us, so therefore we practice that on each other.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.560]   So the greatest pursuit of any Christian is to be more loving, in particular to the brothers
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.800]   and sisters within the church, it's priority.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.480]   And then the third part, we talk about task, the actual application of what it means to
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.960]   be a body of Christ, why he places us in the body of Christ.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.680]   If you read the scriptures, you'll find various different metaphors that describe the church,
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.000]   how we are the sheep, or we are the bride of Christ, or the temple, and all of these
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.040]   different things are accentuating certain qualities of the church.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.960]   But when the scripture calls us the body of Christ, it is a given understanding that Christ
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.000]   as the head, we as the body, is the physical manifestation of what God desires to do through
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.760]   the church.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.320]   And that's why he calls us the body.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.440]   He's the head who instructs us, teaches us, motivates us, and empowers us, and for his
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.460]   body, whether we are the hand or the feet or the eyes or the tongue, whatever it may
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.400]   be, that we would actually go and do what God calls us to do.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.040]   He uses us for his purpose.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.560]   And again, these passages are not new to us, but in 1 Timothy 3.15, he says, "The church
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.340]   is the pillar and foundation of the truth."
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.720]   So the primary avenue in which he desires to disseminate the truth of God, the gospel
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.620]   message, is through the church.
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.880]   It wasn't simply through individuals, it wasn't through a mission organization, it was primarily
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.880]   through the church.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.080]   Ephesians 3.10-11, "So that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.420]   known manifest to the rulers and authorities in heavenly places.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.020]   This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.420]   So his primary purpose of bringing salvation to the world and the avenue in which he chooses
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.840]   to do that through is through his church.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.760]   In particular, the local church, the local gathering of believers.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.120]   So in his wisdom, he has called us together to function together as we are using our gifts
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.680]   to build up the body of Christ, and as the body of Christ is being built, God uses that
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.840]   to, again, to disseminate his truth in the gospel to the world.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.920]   The church functions as his physical presence on earth.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.580]   The church functions for that purpose.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.120]   And again, that's what it means when he is the body of Christ.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.760]   But we need to be very careful that we don't allow the principles that you and I grow up
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.240]   in in the secular world and to bring that into the church.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.480]   We have to be careful that the way that we build the church, not just the goal, but the
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.080]   means in which we build the church is also kingdom-minded.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.840]   Again, so this morning, what I want to focus on is what Paul is saying here, verses 3-8,
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.520]   and again, what he really has been saying is what is the nature of the church?
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:46.040]   He said in verse 1, to considering the mercy of God, to present our body as a living sacrifice,
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.280]   and again, this is your logical, reasonable act of worship.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.560]   And then in chapter, in verse 2, he goes into the application of that, not to be conformed
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:02.200]   to this world, but be transformed in our thinking, in our mind, that we may be able to participate
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.720]   and understand His will.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.240]   And then the application of what he says in verse 1 and 2, specifically, he says to use
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.520]   the gifts that we have to build up the body of Christ.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.320]   So the first application of our act of worship is to use the gift that God has given us to
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.920]   build up the church.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.660]   Not like the world, not to be conformed to the pattern of this world, but be transformed.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:30.480]   So the way that we build the church must also be Christ-centered, must also be biblical.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.880]   So this morning, what I want to look at is the three principles that I believe that he
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.400]   teaches that ought to look very different than the world that you and I live in.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.560]   Why this kingdom that he is trying to build, his physical manifestation of his kingdom,
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:52.500]   must look different than the kingdom that you and I kind of live in, right?
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:59.200]   Number one, God distributed the gifts so that we would not boast.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.520]   God distributed the gifts so that we would not boast.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.760]   In verse 3, Paul says, "I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.760]   than he ought to think."
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.760]   In other words, don't be puffed up.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.640]   But to think with sober judgment.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.560]   We talked about that last week, that not being puffed up with sober judgment doesn't mean
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.840]   to say, "Oh, woe is me.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.840]   I'm nothing.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.840]   I'm worthless."
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.800]   Instead, to see through God's perspective what he is doing.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.960]   So the very first thing that he says that we need to understand that each has been given
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.020]   according to the measure that God has given to him.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.520]   So the first thing that he tells us is that in the way that we practice our gifts, that
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   we are not to be puffed up, but recognize that whatever it is that you have, God has
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:47.120]   given it to you as a gift in his grace.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:53.000]   That in and of itself, right off the bat, flies against everything that we are taught.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.800]   Ever since we are young, we're little, we're taught self-preservation.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   Why do we need to study?
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   To get better grades.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   Why do you need to get better grades?
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   So you can go to a better school.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   Why do you need to get a better school?
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   So you can get a better job.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.800]   Why do you need to get a better job?
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.760]   So you can have a better life.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.160]   And so everything that we're doing, everything that we have been taught, everything that
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.800]   if we're not careful that we teach our children, falls right in line with the principles that
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.520]   we are taught in this world.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.320]   And if you want to get a good job, if you've ever sat through coaching of how to have a
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.860]   good interview, one of the key things that they'll tell you is you have to learn how
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.920]   to sell yourself.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.500]   So they'll tell you, why should we hire you?
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.000]   You never go in there and say, I'm no good, I'm not gifted in anything, I don't work well
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.640]   with people, you know what I mean?
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.520]   When it's complicated, I don't understand.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.600]   It's like, oh, this is the guy we're looking for, right?
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   You don't do that.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.000]   You go in there, you have to sell yourself.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.480]   I have this degree, I was a valedictorian, and I have this background, and these are
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.360]   my results, and here's my resume, and then you get references, and the references also
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.200]   hype you up and say, this is good, you've got to hire this guy, your company's going
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.500]   to ruin if you don't hire him.
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:05.920]   So everything that we do, we have to sell ourselves for self-preservation, to tell people
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.400]   that we're worthwhile and we're useful, and if you use me, and if you pick me, that it's
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.720]   going to benefit your company.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:18.520]   So everything that we are taught and that we pursue in this world is ultimately self-preservation
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.100]   and self-glory.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:27.620]   But the very essence of the gospel, the very beginning of our salvation is when we are
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.780]   confronted by the holiness of God.
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:36.860]   It humbles us, and it causes us to realize that I'm a sinner, worthy of destruction and
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:37.860]   judgment.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:43.700]   And so, until we humble ourselves and we repent of all of our thinking and all of our actions,
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.040]   we are not saved.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.260]   But the problem that, if we're not careful, that we run into is we are saved when we,
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.060]   we are justified when we humble ourselves, but for whatever the reason, we put on the
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.720]   same type of thinking in the world when it comes to sanctification.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.540]   That if we try hard and if we achieve, and if you read your scripture, and if you do
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.600]   this, and if you make so many disciples and plant the church and you grow a certain amount,
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.300]   and we have this same type of mentality that we are taught in the world, and we bring it
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:21.100]   into the church, and if you look at the church history, church has been corrupted throughout
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.100]   church.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:29.300]   It's a record of corruption of people who are very smart and gifted, who are very talented
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:35.580]   and articulate, who knew the scriptures and utilize it for their own glory, and they ruined
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.740]   the church.
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:43.900]   It is not just justification where he calls us to humble ourselves and empty ourselves.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.660]   It is also our sanctification.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:52.180]   So the very first step of actually serving God, he says, "The gift that you have received,
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.540]   you have been given to you."
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.540]   It has been given to you.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.500]   In fact, the Greek word for the word "gift" is "charismata," and the word for "grace"
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.540]   is "charis."
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:06.280]   So the root word for "gift" and "grace" is the same word.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:12.660]   So by very nature, to say that you've been gifted is to recognize that it was given to
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.660]   you.
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.660]   It's a gift.
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.660]   It's a gift.
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.660]   It's a gift.
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.820]   So whenever we talk about spiritual gifts, we automatically think of the supernatural
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.180]   gifts, the sign gifts, whether it's prophecy or healing, whatever it is.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.260]   But the word "gift" is a very broad term, not specifying any particular gift.
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:35.380]   But sometimes we may think, "Well, I'm not gifted," or it almost seems arrogant to say,
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.380]   "I am gifted."
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.100]   It sounds arrogant to say, "Oh, I'm gifted."
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.500]   I'm gifted.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.500]   You are gifted.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.700]   You should be in the character of saying that because the very essence of the biblical understanding
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:51.260]   of giftedness is that God gave grace to you.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.500]   He gave it to you.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:57.180]   Now, some of you, or a lot of us, have certain personality traits, and you think, "Oh, that's
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.180]   not a gift from God."
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.800]   No, that itself is a gift from God.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.060]   Our very life was given to us as a gift.
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.420]   So the fact that you woke up this morning is a gift.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:13.260]   Whatever it is that God has made you, however He made you, ultimately was not a mistake.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.300]   God made you as a female, that was a gift to you.
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.160]   God made you as a male, that was a gift to you.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.300]   And so the very first thing that He tells us is, "This was given to you as a gift."
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.860]   So that we would not become proud, Ephesians 4:7, it says, "But grace was given to each
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.300]   one of us according to the measure of Christ's gift."
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.060]   Again, 1 Corinthians 4:7, "For who sees anything different in you?
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.600]   What do you have that you did not receive?
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.780]   If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?"
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.220]   He's talking to, again, a church that's divided because they were saying, "You know what?
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.580]   I think this guy's smarter.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.820]   I think this guy's a better speaker.
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:51.820]   I think this guy..."
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.540]   And then they were just kind of starting to get divided, and He said, "This division is
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:01.780]   coming because you don't recognize that whatever it is that you have, it was given to you as
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.780]   a gift."
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:10.140]   So to become proud of whatever gift that we have, whatever that we may be good at, is
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.500]   no different than somebody going around and, you know, you give $100 and somebody won $80
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.980]   and somebody won $20, and the guy who got $100 and say, "Ooh, I got $100.
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:19.980]   What's wrong with you?
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.060]   How come you only have $80?
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.860]   How come you only have $20?"
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:29.220]   It's just as ridiculous if we recognize whatever it is that you have was a gift that was given
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.220]   to you.
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.500]   The very first thing that He makes sure is that we do not boast, that we do not think
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.620]   of ourselves higher than what God has done.
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.100]   And there's a reason why He says in Ephesians 2.8.9, "For by grace you have been saved through
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.960]   faith and this is not your doing.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.960]   You didn't do this.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.580]   It was a gift given to you.
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:54.740]   It was charismata that was given to you, not as a result of work, so that..."
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:55.740]   For what purpose?
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.540]   "So that no one may boast."
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:08.940]   It's almost as if, if you read the Scriptures, that God is specifically concerned about pride.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:14.900]   Now, there's a lot of things that He's concerned about, but if you read the Scriptures carefully,
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:20.720]   that one particular thing about pride, He seems to hone in on on target and He pounds
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.980]   it every time He gets an opportunity that you do not become proud.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.900]   Salvation was given to you by grace, not by works, so that you do not boast.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:35.100]   Romans 3.27, "If salvation is by faith alone, what becomes of boasting?"
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.740]   Paul says, "It is excluded."
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.980]   There is no boasting in our salvation.
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.300]   There's nothing to boast of.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:45.500]   Romans 4.2, "For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about,
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.380]   but not before God."
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.500]   There is no boasting.
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.540]   Paul repeats over and over again that in our salvation, there is no boasting.
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.540]   There is no boasting.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.960]   There is no boasting.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:00.760]   And then he says in 1 Corinthians 1.26-31, he's talking to a church who's divided, and
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.200]   he reminds them, "For consider your calling, brothers.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.240]   Not many of you were wise according to worldly standards.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.280]   Not many were powerful.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:14.480]   Not many were noble birth, but God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise."
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.120]   His whole method of salvation downfounds the principles of the world.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:25.340]   That's why even the Pharisees could not understand, "Why would you choose a tax collector?
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.200]   Why would you choose fishermen who know nothing of the Torah?
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.100]   Why would you choose these men, these zealots?"
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:37.480]   If you look at the character of these 12 men, it flies against every principle in the world.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.440]   And he says he deliberately did that.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.760]   It was not by accident.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.280]   It wasn't because he couldn't find good men among the Pharisees.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:49.440]   He deliberately chose what they considered to be weak because that's exactly what he
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:57.200]   was challenging, the worldly system of self-preservation and self-glorification that brought destruction
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.080]   and judgment upon mankind.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.480]   He was challenging that system.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.000]   In everything that he did was to reverse that.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.720]   He deliberately chose what was weak.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.520]   He deliberately chose what was foolish to dumbfound the wise.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.760]   God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.040]   to nothing that things that are, things that are honored, things that we covet, things
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.780]   that we pursue, so that he can physically demonstrate all of that is rubbish in the
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.340]   presence of God.
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.000]   So that no human being might boast in the presence of God.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.020]   He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, whom God made.
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.200]   He is our wisdom, our righteousness, our sanctification and redemption.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:43.300]   Therefore, as it is written, "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:48.120]   He made it so that in our salvation, that if there's any boasting, the only boasting
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:53.120]   that we can have is Christ crucified.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.600]   We can't point to our church.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.820]   We can't point to certain leadership.
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:02.100]   We can't point to certain systems, certain organization, certain Bible study method or
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:07.320]   discipleship method, none of that, so that we would not boast and just simply point to
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.600]   the cross.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.440]   And I believe that the reason why he chose fishermen is because people would be amazed.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.920]   Like, how do these fishermen have such authority, would speak with such clarity?
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.120]   Clearly they're not educated.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.040]   Clearly they're not talented.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.800]   Clearly they don't have honor.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.880]   They don't walk into a city to preach the gospel and they're like, "God chose these
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.880]   people?
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.600]   These are the people that God chose?"
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.880]   And he said he did it deliberately.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.140]   He did it deliberately because the people who are low would have an easier time pointing
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.600]   to Christ.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.440]   Because people who were of substance may come and say, "Maybe some of it was me.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.600]   Good thing that God chose me."
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.880]   The reason why this is the case is 1 John 2, 16, it says, "For all that is in the world,
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.920]   the desires of the flesh, the desires of the eyes, and the pride in possession is not from
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.240]   the Father, but from the world."
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:10.240]   At the core of what he says in 1 John 2, 16 is that this desire, ultimately it resides
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.560]   in our own pride.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.360]   And he said pride is not from the Father.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.560]   And the reason why he says that, if you look at Genesis chapter 3, 6, the very essence
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.040]   of why Adam and Eve fell, it mimics what John says in 1 John.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.160]   He says, "For when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:35.320]   delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.600]   it its fruit and ate."
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.900]   She wanted to become wise.
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.980]   She wanted to become somebody.
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.160]   She wanted to glorify herself.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.880]   And as a result of that, sin came in.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.760]   And it destroyed mankind.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.080]   It is not just in justification where he humbles us.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.600]   It is in the beginning of sanctification he also humbles us.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:04.000]   In the way that we serve, he says, "It was given to you as a gift, so that no one may
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.840]   boast."
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:11.260]   So not only do we begin in humility, we continue in humility.
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:16.280]   Because it is our desire to make something of ourselves, to be recognized, to become
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.720]   somebody of substance, whether it is outside the church, inside the church, that is ruining
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.840]   us.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:29.920]   Every part of what Jesus did in his ministry, even if he came as Caesar, it would be humbling
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.400]   for him.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.760]   Because he made Caesar.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.320]   In a snap of a finger, he could destroy Rome.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.900]   And he could have demonstrated his power.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.520]   He could have demonstrated his authority.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:48.600]   He is an omnipotent, omnipresent, immutable God.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.900]   Even if he came as Caesar, it would have been humbling.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.660]   But why did he come?
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:20:00.440]   To a poor young couple, a carpenter, born in a manger.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.800]   In fact, when people would come because they recognized that maybe he is the Messiah, they
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.120]   would come, "Hey, can we follow you?"
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.600]   Remember what Jesus said?
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.720]   "Foxes have holes, birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   his head."
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.280]   In other words, if you come follow me, you are looking for glory.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.200]   I am homeless.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.520]   If you want to come, follow me.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:23.640]   When people wanted to come and they were asking, "When the kingdom comes, if you are the Messiah
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.680]   and you are the king, let me sit on the left or to the right," because they were thinking
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.680]   of glory.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:35.960]   They were applying the worldly principle in the kingdom of God and Jesus corrects them.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.880]   It is not for me to give that to you.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:45.360]   If you want to come follow me, deny yourself and pick up your cross and follow me.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.720]   There is a reason why he went to the cross.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:53.080]   There is a reason why we celebrate the incarnation because it is not simply the cross itself,
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:59.920]   but everything that led to the cross teaches us that the principle of this world of trying
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:05.940]   to elevate themselves is at the root of the sin of mankind.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:11.040]   So if we apply that principle in building the church, it will ruin us.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:16.600]   So the first thing that he tells us is that, "Do you not know that God has apportioned
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.360]   the gifts according to the measure of faith?"
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.200]   He did it in his wisdom.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.960]   That's why he says in Philippians 2, 1-5, a church that has been divided because of
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.280]   these two prominent ladies.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.580]   He says, "If there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:39.840]   in spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:45.360]   Having the same love, being in full accord in one mind, do nothing from rivalry or conceit,
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.440]   but in humility count others more significant than yourselves."
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.080]   He's saying if you want to build a church, if any of you have been affected by the cross,
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:01.280]   the application of that ought to be that we would have the same mind of Christ who deliberately
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.040]   humbled himself, became nothing.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.240]   And he considered others better than themselves.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:14.760]   Isn't the root of contention between husband and wives, between family members, between
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:21.320]   church, between friends, coworkers, isn't the root of it in many times because we suddenly
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.400]   think we're better.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.080]   I know better than you.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.900]   I can do this better than you.
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:27.900]   I know better than you.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:28.900]   I've learned more than you.
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.960]   I have more experience than you.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.360]   And he says, "Have the mind of Christ."
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:38.440]   If Christ's humility has affected you, you should apply that in your life by considering
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.440]   others better.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.440]   Lower yourself.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.360]   You're working to higher yourself, you work to lower yourself.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:51.400]   See, at the root of salvation is humiliation.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.920]   At the root of building the church is also humiliation.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.960]   And that's why the very first thing is that do you not know that he deliberately made
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.440]   you low for that purpose.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.900]   It is a gift.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.300]   Whatever it is that you're gifted in, whatever it is that you can contribute, it was given
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.440]   to you as a gift.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:16.000]   In fact, you know, let's go to the number two because it'll fall on the second one.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   God humbles us.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.960]   Secondly, the way he builds the church, God assigned the gift as he saw fit that we would
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.120]   not covet what others have.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.720]   God assigned the gifts as he saw fit that we would not covet what other people have.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.540]   These are obviously interrelated.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:39.400]   If you're proud, if you don't recognize that, obviously the next thing would be related
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.160]   if God humbles you that we would not covet what other people have because you recognize
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.520]   that God's the one who gave it to you.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.200]   He didn't just spread out the gifts and then you went out and took it.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   He said no.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:58.320]   In his wisdom, in his omniscient, he apportioned to each person according to how he saw fit.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.840]   In 1 Corinthians 12, 11, all these are empowered by one in the same spirit who apportioned
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.680]   to each one individually as he wills.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:12.480]   When we look at our spiritual gifts and then we begin to covet what other people have,
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   say, "You know what?
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.480]   I don't like the way God made me.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.600]   I want to be made that way."
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:22.080]   At the root of that, at the root of that is a rebellion against God.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:27.560]   It may seem like humility, but it is not because at the root of it, you're questioning God's
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.720]   sovereignty in your life.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.400]   I don't want what God gave me.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.840]   I want what they have.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.200]   Any kind of coveting is a rejection of his lordship over our lives.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.480]   I didn't recognize that when I was a younger Christian when I first came into ministry.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.460]   I don't want to go into the details, but that's one of the first lessons that I learned coming
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:51.520]   into ministry because I would automatically think if you gave your life to full-time ministry
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:57.360]   that you automatically assume, "Well, you've sacrificed everything and now you're ready.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.360]   You're emptied."
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.960]   But I realized as I searched my heart, that wasn't the case.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.840]   I had a very specific design of how I was going to serve God.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:12.320]   I remember one of the very first guys that I shared the gospel and became a Christian.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.960]   His father was furious because obviously he had great plans and then his dad was not a
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.320]   believer.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.880]   When he realized that he became a Christian, he was upset.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.520]   Then later on, he decided to go into seminary.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.320]   We were having Bible study, he came back with all kinds of scars.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:33.320]   Basically he got physically, his dad got really angry and he lost control.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.320]   He came and he was in tears and he was sharing with me what happened.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:42.040]   I remember him telling me, he said, "All his life he was a goofball.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.560]   He would ditch school.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.560]   He was doing drugs.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.960]   Finally, I commit my life to Christ and I want to serve him and my dad's angry with
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.560]   me."
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.640]   He ended up living with me for a while.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.080]   Then after a while, his dad realized that he was serious and his dad wanted to have
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.440]   lunch with us.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.520]   He took our roommates out.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.200]   I remember the specific thing that he said to us.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.400]   He said, "Well, my son becoming a pastor was not my plan, was not my desire.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.160]   Obviously, that's not what I wanted.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.680]   But if you're going to be a pastor, be Billy Graham."
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.640]   That's what he said.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.800]   If you're going to be a pastor, rule the church basically.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.400]   Because as a non-Christian, that was his thought.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.720]   That's not what I really want from you, but if you're going to be, be the best that you
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.720]   can be.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.840]   Whether you're a Buddhist monk or a priest, whatever you're going to be, be on top.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.840]   Obviously, we were all kind of like, "Okay.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.200]   Thank you for the advice."
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:46.080]   But how much of that suddenly creeps into the church and in our hearts that even in
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:53.000]   the context of serving God, there's a part of us that, "I want to glorify God, but I
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   want to glorify God.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.120]   It has to be me.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.040]   I have to do it a certain way."
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.720]   Every part of Jesus's ministry is the warning, the natural nature that you and I have.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:11.840]   Because we've been taught this since the day we were born, to make something of yourself.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.760]   Our parents pushed that on us because that's the world that they grew up in.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.840]   And then we tried and certain things we succeeded, and then certain things we failed.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.040]   And then when we have children, we place it on them.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.200]   We want them to be successful and we do that to them.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:32.320]   Because Jesus recognizes our innate nature is not to submit.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:37.760]   Our innate nature is self-preservation, is self-glory.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.960]   There's a reason why over and over and over and over, he said, there is no boasting in
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.900]   our salvation.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:48.400]   And there is no boasting in our sanctification.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:53.120]   There's a reason why the very last image he left with his disciples was him on his knees
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.120]   washing their feet.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.120]   That was the last image.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.920]   It wasn't him at the mountain preaching and teaching.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.400]   It wasn't him healing and raising Lazarus from the dead.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.440]   That was not the last picture that he left with his disciples.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:14.440]   The last image, deliberate image, lesson that he was trying to teach them, was on his knees.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:19.880]   He was on his knees washing their feet and on his knees praying before his father.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:25.520]   That was the last image that he gave to his disciples.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:31.600]   Every part of our salvation screams to humble ourselves.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.960]   First Corinthians 12, 15 to 18, it says, "If the foot should say, 'Because I am not a hand,
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.880]   I do not belong to the body,' that would not make it any less a part of the body.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.600]   And if the ear should say, 'Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,' that
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.880]   would not make it any less part of the body.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.080]   If the whole body were an eye, where would the same sense of hearing be?
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.320]   If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.720]   But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose."
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.440]   And that's the key verse.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.800]   As he chose.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.760]   You know, the interesting thing here is in that he says he apportioned it according to
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.760]   faith.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.240]   Now, there's a debate as to is he talking about the objective faith of the gospel or
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.200]   is he talking about subjective application?
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.240]   And I don't think it has to be one or the other.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.240]   Both.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.640]   He's talking about according to faith, meaning according to the principle of the gospel that
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:27.200]   we've heard to humble ourselves, but also according to the subjective application of
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.200]   that gospel.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.360]   Now, let me explain what I mean by that.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.280]   When I get challenged, and Esther and I, you know, God created us very differently with
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:42.520]   different gifts, when I get challenged and say, "Hey, live your life to honor and glorify
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.520]   God.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.200]   Let's really serve God and be obedient."
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:52.440]   My natural reaction is to grab my Bible and run to the campus and preach the gospel.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.520]   Like that's my natural inclination.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:00.240]   So if Esther and I were both convicted by the message and we didn't have a conversation
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:05.080]   about how we were going to apply this, and we just say, "Yeah, let's go," Esther will
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.640]   immediately grab her apron and run to the kitchen.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.280]   I'll grab my Bible and run to the campus.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.760]   And then we say, "Hey, I thought we were going to serve God."
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:19.400]   And then she'll look at me and say, "Yeah, where are you going?"
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.720]   Because God created us differently.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.640]   So when we say like, "How do you apply the love of God?"
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.800]   Oftentimes it's going to look very different.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.400]   So I can look at that and say, "What are you doing in the kitchen?
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.240]   We need to go out."
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.040]   And then the people in the kitchen will look at me like, "How come you never serve?
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.800]   You only want the glory."
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:46.720]   So when he says, "According to what God has given you," not to say, "I need to learn.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.600]   I need to learn how to serve.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.140]   I need to be in the background and do these things.
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.800]   And there are people in the church who need to learn how to be on campus and share the
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.640]   gospel that we support and help each other."
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.260]   But God has uniquely gifted us in our personalities.
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:04.600]   And even when we talk about serving, our application is going to be very different.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:11.340]   And if we're humble and we recognize that, we can value the gifts, the different gifts
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.000]   that we have instead of pointing and say, "How come they're not coming out on the street?
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   And how come they're not doing this?
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.520]   And how come they're not doing that?"
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.760]   Recognizing that the application is going to look different in different people.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.280]   According to what he has given.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:28.600]   And as a result of that, God's kingdom is glorified.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:34.120]   If there's any gift that he tells us to covet, he commands us to covet, he says in 1 Corinthians
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:39.160]   12, 31, "But earnestly desire the higher gifts."
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.440]   And what are the higher gifts?
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.920]   Teaching?
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.280]   Leading?
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.700]   No.
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:47.840]   What does he say the higher gift is?
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:52.000]   In 1 Corinthians 13, 13, "So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.440]   But the greatest of these is," what?
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.640]   "Love."
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:00.960]   If you're going to covet anything in the church, covet people who are good at loving.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:06.000]   If you're going to envy anybody at church and desire, "I want to be more like that person,"
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.920]   see who really is good at loving.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.320]   Who's giving, sacrificing, encouraging.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.880]   Who is good at applying love?
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:20.400]   And he said, "If you're going to covet anything, covet that."
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:26.360]   See, even the application, even the way he gave us the gift to serve, it humbles us.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:31.160]   It prevents us from coveting when we recognize that God in his wisdom gave me what he gave
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.320]   me.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:40.520]   In fact, you know, it doesn't take much for us to become proud.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.360]   You know, and I've shared this in the previous sermon before, that those of you who are taller
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:52.160]   than others, you have greater work because you enter a room, everybody's smaller, shorter
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.040]   than you.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.840]   I know what's going on in your head.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.360]   Your grades are better, you know, you got an A plus.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.640]   Your neighbor got an A. You know, I know what's going on in your head.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.440]   You know, you got a better job.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.120]   You make a little bit more money.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.040]   Maybe you're better looking, or at least you think so.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:18.520]   Maybe you got better hair, or maybe you got a better deal.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.840]   Use your points better than the other people.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.560]   It doesn't take much.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.520]   It really does not take much.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.560]   You know, you sing better, whatever it is.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.320]   You know, if you look at the way that God created the kingdom, if the primary thing
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:41.280]   that causes us, that prevents us from getting to God is our own pride, is whatever causes
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.120]   you to have pride, is your primary hindrance.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.440]   That's exactly what James says in the book of James, that those who don't have money
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.520]   should glory in their high position.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:57.360]   And those who have money say, "You don't know, but you have a strike against you because
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.840]   you have to work harder to rely on God.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.240]   You have to work harder to be humble.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:06.920]   Whatever it is that you are good at, you don't recognize that that's the source of pride
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:12.160]   that's causing you, or preventing you, or make it harder for you to worship God purely,
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.720]   to serve God purely."
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.540]   And that's exactly what he said he did.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:22.660]   He took the principles of the world and he flipped it upside down in the church.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:26.640]   And there's a reason why he took tax collectors and made them the leaders.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.120]   Because they would never be leaders in the Jewish kingdom.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.680]   They would never be leaders.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.560]   A prostitute coming into the church and becoming prominent?
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.260]   Are you kidding me?
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:41.240]   Somebody who was a slave is one of the first preachers of the gospel?
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.280]   A murderer?
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:50.080]   He did that deliberately because he was trying to challenge a fallen world where the whole
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:57.120]   system is based upon succeeding and becoming somebody.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:01.640]   And you come into the presence of God and He says, "If you seek your life, you'll lose
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.640]   it."
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.920]   And he loses his life for my sake.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.000]   He will find it.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   It is not just in justification.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.720]   It's the very core of sanctification.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.320]   He keeps us humble.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.360]   It humbles us.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.840]   It prevents us from coveting.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.740]   And third and finally, the very gifts, the way he gave it to us, he deliberately used
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.200]   it as an avenue to worship God and serve others.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.720]   The two greatest commands is to love God and to love one another.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.560]   And he said, "The very essence of your gift is not to glorify yourself.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.560]   It's not to display.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.560]   Look what I'm doing.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.960]   Look what I'm doing."
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.360]   It's to humble ourselves and serve.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:43.560]   So if we're not humble and we're coveting, the application of that is you're not going
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.480]   to serve either.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:51.360]   But if God humbles you and recognizes that God gave you the gift, the natural application
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.520]   of that is whatever it is that God gives me, I use that to serve other people.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:59.440]   First Corinthians 12, 7, "To each given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.320]   good."
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:07.280]   Whatever it is that God has given to you as a gift, it was for other people's benefit,
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.720]   not simply yours.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.400]   First Peter 4, 10 through 11, "As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.840]   as good stewards of God's very grace.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.760]   Whoever speaks as one who speaks oracles of God, whoever serves as one who serves by the
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:25.920]   strength that God supplies in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.800]   Christ."
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:34.120]   He gives us a list of these gifts, where it's a prophesying, serving, teaching, exhorting,
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.720]   contributing, all of these things.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.720]   Two things.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.040]   One, it's not comprehensive.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:42.080]   There's many, many other gifts that are mentioned in the New Testament or not mentioned that
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.080]   the church has.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:48.000]   So the point of this is not to give a comprehensive list and say, "Well, which one am I?"
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.760]   Nor is it exclusive, meaning that these are the only gifts and maybe some of you are gifted
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.840]   in many of these things.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.960]   So it's not comprehensive.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:56.960]   It is not exclusive.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.640]   The point of it is, whatever it is that God has given you, to use it to honor and glorify
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.840]   God and to serve one another.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.080]   So let me just quickly go over.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:08.360]   It says prophesy in proportion to our faith, in application.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.820]   So prophesying, we typically think prophesying means foretelling.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.440]   Something is coming and so you tell ahead of time.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.520]   That is a specific application of that, but the broader application of the term prophesying
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.480]   basically means to proclaim God's Word.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:27.700]   So if God has gifted you in prophesying, He says to do it.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.880]   In serving, in our serving.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.640]   If God has gifted you, you know, and I know like sometimes we joke, "Hey, your gift is
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.100]   serving so go serve."
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:42.000]   Everybody is gifted in serving in different capacities, but He's talking about people
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.800]   who are particularly gifted in serving.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.280]   There are some people who are gifted in serving.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.200]   Whenever they serve, we're encouraged.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:54.280]   And it's not just because they serve, it's just they serve in a way that God is worshipped.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:58.760]   And I'm always encouraged, whether I'm in McDonald's or a restaurant and you can see
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:05.120]   a waitress who is doing her job and she's just bitter and angry that she has to serve
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.480]   these ungrateful people.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.780]   And you could just tell, even when the food comes, like you don't want to like it.
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:15.720]   And then everyone's like, you know, every Saturday morning we have leaders meetings.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:21.720]   Every 6, 6, 15 to 630, most of the days I go to the, I go to McDonald's and I grab a
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.520]   cup of coffee.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:28.440]   And for whatever the reason, the most cheerful people are there in the morning, for whatever
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.440]   the reason.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:33.800]   And every time I grab that cup of coffee, it brightens my day.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.080]   These are hardworking people.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:39.280]   They don't get paid much, but they're working so hard, you know.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.760]   And they're, they're, they're cheerful in what they're doing.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.280]   So he said, there's some people in the room where your really gift isn't serving.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:50.360]   Like you get energized and you energize other people every time you serve.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.160]   You inspire people to serve.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.760]   He said, if your gift isn't serving, serve.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.440]   And the church is being built up because of you.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:04.480]   The one who teaches in his teaching, this is the one who exhorts in his exhortation.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.000]   Some of you guys are really good at encouraging.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.240]   I don't think that's my gift.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.120]   Even when I encourage, people are discouraged.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.120]   And I don't understand.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.120]   It's like, that's not what I meant.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.200]   And they read in between the line, it's like, oh, I know what you really meant.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:23.000]   You know, but some of you guys are really good at encouraging.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.920]   If that's you, you know, you like to like write little notes and any little positive
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:31.840]   things that you see, you're, you're, you're eager to tell them, to exhort them, encourage
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:32.840]   them.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:37.040]   You have no idea how much that builds the church.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.040]   You have no idea.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.240]   I've encouraged somebody who just had a lousy week, something horrible happened in their
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:46.040]   week, and, and you didn't even know, but you're, you're exercising of your gift.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:52.000]   Encouragement, exhortation, to do that well and thrive in God is worship and church is
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.640]   built in something that you may think is trivial, but how the church is built as a result of
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.640]   that.
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:03.760]   He said, in your contribution, in generosity.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.760]   You know, one thing I noticed is that people who are the most generous are not the, are
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.800]   not the, you know, people who are always generous in small things.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.640]   I mean, people use money differently, you know.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.040]   Like some people are really good with money.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.000]   They save it and then they don't use it and they don't travel and when they go out to
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.080]   eat, they always, you know, think about the cost.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:26.240]   But when it, when it's time to give for something meaningful, they write a fat check because
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.440]   that's what they were planning and they raised money for that and they kept it in the bank
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.040]   and when the good cause comes, they write the check.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.280]   And I noticed that the people who are the most generous are not the ones who are always
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.600]   out spending money.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:45.040]   He says, obviously we are all called to give, you know.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.720]   And this is something that I've learned and when I first started ministry, I thought I
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.320]   was going to become a businessman and I'm going to use my finances to help people and
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.320]   stuff.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:41:01.040]   But I realized, like if you're not generous, don't pray for money because money will ruin
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.440]   you.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.800]   You're asking for something.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:11.680]   If you're, if you are not gifted in giving and giving doesn't cause you joy and it's
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.000]   not an avenue for you to worship God, don't ask for money because money will ruin you
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.480]   and God's not going to answer your prayer.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:22.600]   He's not going to answer a prayer that's going to cause you to drift away from God.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.280]   His primary goal is not for you to live well and comfortable and buy a nice house and that's
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.440]   not his goal for you.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.120]   I mean, this world is going to be gone one day.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:36.360]   He's not going to answer your prayers so that your hearts would drift away from God.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:45.280]   You know, there are some people in the church that you could, you know, you could become
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:49.400]   a multi-millionaire and it would bless everybody else for you to become a multi-millionaire
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:53.840]   because when God gives you money, it's not just you.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.200]   Everybody is blessed.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:01.560]   So again, just as a general principle, if you're not in the habit of being generous,
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.180]   don't ask for money because that money will ruin you because you're asking for something
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:09.640]   else that you have to fight against to get to God and God's not going to give that to
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.760]   you if that's the reason, right?
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:19.240]   So if you're gifted in generosity, in giving, give generously and those who lead do it with
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.300]   zeal.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:24.120]   This is one aspect that I was, you know, as I was studying through this and it came to
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:32.080]   that is like conviction because I am, I look at myself, I am in the habit and there are
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:37.200]   some weeks where I'm like, just one more, one more thing goes wrong.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.120]   One more drama, one more thing, I'm out.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:45.640]   I don't think I'll do it, but I'm always threatening everybody.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.480]   One more thing, one more, I can't take it anymore.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:51.680]   And you know, I love God, I love the church, but one more thing, I'm out.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.400]   And I was studying through this thing, it's like, no, if you're going to lead, lead with
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.160]   zeal, commit.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.840]   Don't have one foot in the door and one foot out the door and say, well, if you have these
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.840]   things, I'm going to be in.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.360]   If you don't have these things, I'm going to be out.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.080]   He said, no, if you're going to lead, lead with zeal, commit with passion.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.440]   Again, I was convicted by that.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:15.120]   And the one who acts of mercy with cheerfulness.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:21.040]   And I believe the reason why that is is because when you're giving and you're gifted in mercy,
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:26.440]   this is a pattern that I see a lot of times when you are in mercy ministry, and again,
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.640]   mercy ministry doesn't have to be you're out in the streets.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.160]   There's a lot of people who are mercy ministry even in the church.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.680]   Whenever somebody's in need, you're the first group of people that get there.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.640]   And it's just giving, giving, giving.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.960]   You're not discipling, you're not trying to raise something, you're just like, somebody's
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:43.800]   in need, you're there, and that's your gift.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:49.840]   But the flip side of that is, it's hardest to be patient with people that you've been
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.000]   the most sacrificial for.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.960]   Because you've given to them so much, you've sacrificed for them so much.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.000]   That's why it's so hard to be patient with our own children.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.080]   Because it's a one-sided relationship, right?
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.640]   And you know, if you're a parent, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:10.820]   Like, you pour out, I mean, they wouldn't live if it wasn't for you.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.520]   So for them to rebel against you and question you, how dare you?
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:20.880]   So it's hard for us to be patient, especially if you poured out to that person sacrificially.
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.480]   And I remember, you know, years ago, when we'd go out on the streets, you know, we would
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.200]   get the donuts and prepare every week.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:32.160]   And every single week, we'd go out, and after a while, I started hearing the grumbling and
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.660]   complaining.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:34.960]   We ran out of food.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.920]   So the people who ate were happy, and then there would always be a segment of people
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.120]   that's like, man, these guys didn't bring enough food, or after a while, they got sick
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:47.200]   of the hot dogs or the sandwiches or the dried donuts, and then I would hear the grumbling.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.760]   And then I would take the clothes that we would bring out there, and then they would
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.200]   go and fight for it, and whoever didn't get what they wanted, they was like, ah, you know,
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.440]   what's wrong with you?
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:02.480]   And after a while, I realized, oh my gosh, people are so ungrateful.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.560]   And you want to quit.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:08.080]   So I see a lot of people who start mercy ministry with great intention, and after two, three
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.860]   years, like, forget that.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:19.000]   And it's not just mercy, but when we practice grace with people and we sacrificially give,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.040]   there's a tendency for us to become much more impatient.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:29.320]   And that's why he says, if that's you, with cheerfulness, because we're not doing it to
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:33.040]   get something from you, but it's an act of worship.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:37.880]   And as harder it is, the greater God is glorified.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:43.320]   That's why the focus ultimately is to glorify God through serving people.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.000]   You see, in God's wisdom, why he did that?
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.560]   Why he said, like, the very first thing he says to worship God as a living sacrifice,
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:56.600]   to not be transformed, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, and then the
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:02.840]   very first thing he says is, do not think of yourself highly, because he knows that
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:08.200]   even in our sanctification, we can easily compete.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.720]   Who's doing more?
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.440]   Who's not doing what they're supposed to do?
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.440]   Who's in the kitchen?
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.440]   Who's not in the kitchen?
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.440]   Who's serving?
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.440]   Who's not serving?
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.440]   Who's giving?
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.440]   Who's not giving?
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.040]   And then we create the same kind of principles that we applied in the church, and all of
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.560]   a sudden, the same problems outside, we bring it into the church.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:29.000]   But he said that the kingdom of God ought to be different.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.560]   Let me conclude with a practical application of this, because the application now is, okay,
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.560]   now how do I serve?
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.640]   Now, what if I don't know what my gift is?
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.640]   And so there's two.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:44.280]   There's somebody who's so clear about his gift, and they're frustrated that maybe, you
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:47.600]   know, like, I want to be able to use my gift, or you got the other person, I don't know
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:50.360]   what my gift is, so I can't serve.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.720]   One is, here's my gift, I don't have an opportunity.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:57.120]   The other one is, I don't know what my gift is, so I can't serve.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:02.080]   The application of our gift, like, you don't know, you won't know what your gift is unless
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.880]   you're, unless it's in the context of the body of Christ.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.120]   And let me explain what I mean by that.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.280]   Are you hospitable?
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.040]   Are you a good singer?
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.520]   Are you generous?
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.280]   Are you patient?
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:25.160]   If you say yes or no, how did you know that?
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.000]   Somebody told you, right?
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Somebody probably told you.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   You say, "Man, you're really patient."
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   Like, how do you know that?
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.400]   Because they see the way you interact.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.760]   Or say, "Oh, you're really hospitable.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.360]   They watch your life and what you do.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.360]   Oh, you're really generous."
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:42.400]   Because they're watching your interaction with other people, so you find out your gift
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.920]   in the context of the body of Christ.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:47.360]   And there's certain things that you don't, you're not good at.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.360]   You also know.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.520]   So you don't come in there like, "I'm the best singer in the world."
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.520]   Nobody's heard you.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.600]   You'll be the judge of that.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:00.160]   We'll let you know.
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.400]   If you come in and say, "Well, I'm gifted in this."
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.680]   Well, how do we know that?
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.960]   So our giftedness is found out in the context of serving the church.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.440]   Well, what if I don't know what my gift is?
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:16.680]   Well, it's in the context of serving in the capacity where there's a need, where there
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:17.680]   is a need.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.400]   Give me an example of that.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.200]   When I first entered into ministry, the bulk of my time when we had gatherings was not
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.840]   preaching and teaching because they didn't need that.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:31.920]   We had other leaders, and I was a young guy, so I spent a lot of time leading worship on
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.880]   campus ministry.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.720]   And after a while, I could tell that I'm not necessarily gifted in this.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.000]   There are some people really gifted.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.680]   And I remember very specifically, is Luke here?
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.680]   Luke King?
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.440]   Okay, Luke is here.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:51.160]   So I remember very specifically, when Luke was very young, I forget how old he was.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.480]   He must have been no more than...
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.520]   I was never your youth pastor, right?
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:59.160]   Yeah, I was his older sister's youth pastor, but I remember when he was very young, he
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.320]   wanted to learn how to play guitar.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.640]   Now, he didn't learn it from me, but I taught him some chords.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.040]   He may not remember that.
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.040]   You're welcome.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.960]   But I taught him some chords, right?
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.680]   I've been leading worship for years, you know?
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:17.120]   So I was a youth pastor, I was leading worship, but doing all this stuff.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:21.160]   And I remember he picked up the guitar, and about three months later, I heard somebody
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.240]   playing in the auditorium, and I said, "Wow, that's really good.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.240]   Somebody can play."
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:29.960]   And I walk in, and Luke's playing, and not only did he go beyond the three chords that
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:34.640]   I taught him, he bypassed me in three months.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:40.000]   What I was doing for probably about 10 years, that's when I knew I wasn't gifted in this.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.440]   That's not my gift.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:47.160]   He picked it up in three months.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:52.400]   We don't know what our gift is until we begin to serve where the need is.
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:55.840]   And as we're serving, there's some things that you may not be good at, and then you
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.320]   kind of get shifted, and then certain things that you're really good at, and then you get
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.720]   more responsibility.
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:04.060]   And so the beginning of application is wherever there's a need.
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:09.540]   And where we also see that being applied is, Apostle Paul was not the greatest preacher,
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:12.520]   and yet God called him to preach.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:16.800]   And you remember when Apostle Paul, in one of his letters, he said, "His letters are
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.400]   strong, but his presence is weak."
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.520]   And I've heard pastors make fun of his appearance.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:26.840]   They think, "Oh, he was short and bald, and maybe not that attractive."
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.400]   I don't think they're talking about his appearance.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:33.440]   I personally don't think it's his appearance, because he was writing these letters with
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.440]   such authority.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:39.360]   He's an apostle of Jesus Christ, and he's rebuking the church, and they didn't like
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.800]   what he had to say.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:44.520]   And he said, "Wow, when he writes, it comes with this authority, but when he comes to
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.780]   speak, he's weak.
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:50.760]   He doesn't have that commanding presence, so maybe his stature had something to do with
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.760]   it."
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.160]   But he was not the best preacher.
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.440]   Apollos was.
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:51:00.900]   Apollos was known to be the articulate preacher, so that's why everybody was flocking to him.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:06.600]   But yet God called him to be apostle to the Gentiles, in his wisdom.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.720]   So sometimes God uses us because there's a need.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:10.900]   Remember Moses?
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:12.120]   God calls him to be a spokesperson.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:15.680]   He said, "Oh, I stutter.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.680]   You don't have the right person.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.680]   You want to call my brother.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.240]   He's a good preacher."
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:24.200]   And God didn't say, "You're a humble man."
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.200]   That's what I was looking for.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.200]   That's not what happened.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.820]   Remember what he said?
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:30.700]   He rebuked him.
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:33.460]   He rebuked him for being arrogant.
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:36.560]   What he thought was being humble, he said, "You're arrogant."
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:41.400]   The reason why he was arrogant is that you think I called you because I need you.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.120]   I created your mouth.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.320]   I created your mouth.
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:46.680]   I gave you that mouth.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.240]   So if I called you, I'm going to speak through you.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.400]   All you have to do is do what I tell you."
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.520]   And so he called him to be faithful.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:02.680]   See the using of our gift, what we're good at, what we're not good at, these are things
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:07.980]   that we find out when we humble ourselves and serve because there's a need.
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:13.840]   And so what God calls us to, and again, this is a cliche, but what God calls us to ultimately
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:18.480]   is not ultimately fruitfulness, but faithfulness.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   That's why in John 15 it says, "You cannot bear fruit unless you abide in me."
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:27.240]   So his primary thing that he calls us to do is to be faithful.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.880]   Be faithful where God placed you.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.000]   Be faithful with the needs.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.480]   Because our natural inclination is, again, even when we look for churches, we want to
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:39.000]   go somewhere where I'm going to be met, my needs are going to be met, but he flips that
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.440]   around.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:44.720]   Where can you be of the most use?
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.900]   Where can you serve God?
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.160]   Where can you glorify God?
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:53.800]   Where is the greatest need is what we should be thinking.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.840]   Because that's what he did in his kingdom.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.520]   That's what he did in the church.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:02.360]   He called us to be faithful, first and foremost.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:08.480]   Ephesians 4, 16, "For him, from him, the whole body joined and held together by every supporting
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:14.200]   ligament grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work."
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:19.520]   So isn't that the beauty of Christ?
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.720]   That's the beauty of the church.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.280]   We don't have to be significant.
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.460]   We don't have to be intelligent.
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.880]   We don't have to be the most gifted.
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:29.380]   You don't have to be wealthy.
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:32.860]   You don't have to be successful in this world.
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:37.920]   You just need to love Christ with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.160]   And love your brother as yourself.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:46.720]   He flipped the principle, this rat race that you and I have to run because we live in this
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:53.400]   world, that we do not bring that into the church, that we do not build the church like
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:58.820]   they build their kingdom, that Christ and Christ alone may be glorified.
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:07.860]   So if any fruit comes and they ask you why, that none of us points to me, to the organization,
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:14.540]   to the structure, that every single one of us will recognize the head of the church,
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:15.540]   Christ.
[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:21.700]   Again, let's take some time to pray as we ask our worship team to come up.
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:25.680]   And again, be very specific about application.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.260]   You can hear that and say, "Oh, that's great.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:28.540]   These are good principles."
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:35.020]   But in application, how does God call you to apply that according to your faith?
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:40.020]   What are some specific things in your thinking, in your judgment, in your practice that we
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:42.340]   need to be sanctified?
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:46.940]   So again, let's take some time to come before the Lord in prayer as our worship team leads
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:47.940]   us.
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:48.940]   Let's pray.
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:52.020]   (pterodactyl snorts)
