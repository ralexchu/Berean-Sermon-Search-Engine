[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.980]   Hebrews 10.5 - 19.5 (Verse 25) (Hebrews 10.5 - 19.5)
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.080]   Reading out of the NASB, "Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.720]   place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.940]   the veil, that is, His flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.780]   let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.740]   clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.340]   Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful.
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.140]   And let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.700]   own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.860]   the more as you see the day drawing near."
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.580]   Let's pray.
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.260]   Heavenly Father, we thank You for Your goodness.
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.940]   We thank You for the privilege that we have to come and draw near to the throne of grace
[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.940]   with confidence.
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.160]   I pray that Your word would have its effect on us.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.740]   May it not return until it has accomplished the purpose that You have ordained.
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.180]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.420]   You know, today, if somebody says that they're Christian, the word Christian has been diluted
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.140]   to the point where you have to ask further questions.
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.140]   What kind of Christian?
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.140]   Do you believe the Bible?
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.540]   Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.940]   Do you believe that Christ is the only way?
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.380]   And you have to clarify that because more than 70% of the United States identify with
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.840]   Christianity.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.820]   So people say that they're Christian because they were born into a Christian home.
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.340]   People say that they're Christian because they admire Jesus as a great man.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.380]   People will say that they're Christians simply because they're surrounded by other Christians.
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.260]   And so for whatever the reason, the term Christian itself isn't what it used to be.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.320]   So you have to figure out, like, what specifically do they believe?
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.080]   And we find out that, you know, the majority of people who claim to be Christians are not
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.340]   biblical Christians, meaning the way that the Bible describes what a Christian is.
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.900]   Well, years ago, that was not the case.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.780]   When the term Christian was first given to Christians, it was to identify clearly those
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.780]   who belong to Christ.
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.340]   And the word Christian literally just meant those, the little Christ.
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.300]   And so it was identifying people who are followers of Jesus.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.160]   Now prior to that, obviously you had people who said that they were Jews and they were,
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.500]   you know, were they part of the Essenes?
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.500]   Were they Sadducees?
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.500]   Were they Pharisees?
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.580]   Who are they?
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.420]   And so they had all these different distinctions of people who are theists, right?
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.940]   Now, well, you believe in many gods and I worship this god or that god.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.140]   And so when they started calling Christians Christian, that term Christian identified
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.620]   everybody, no matter what background you came from, whether you were formerly an idol worshiper,
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.660]   whether you are a Jew and you worship the God of the Old Testament, but you had different
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.560]   views, different theology.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.780]   So when they say he's a Christian, it was clear identity with the death and resurrection
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.560]   of Jesus Christ and that they were actually following him, that they were new creation.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.680]   The old is gone, behold, the new has come.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.040]   So the biblical understanding of a Christian is a Christian who's made a decision to be
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.000]   a follower of Jesus Christ, not simply an admirer, not simply somebody who says, you
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.800]   know what, I agree with these set of doctrines.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.960]   The Bible makes that very clear.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.820]   Even the demons believe who Jesus is.
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.520]   And because they know who Jesus is, they shudder, they fear.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.100]   They fear God more than average theists in our generation because they know who he is.
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.960]   They know that judgment is coming.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.840]   But in the book of James, it says that just identifying and say, well, we believe, we
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.200]   believe that there's one God.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   Good.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.160]   Even the demons believe that and they shudder.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.280]   So the biblical understanding of a Christian is someone who not only embraces the doctrine,
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.200]   but has identified as a follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.120]   Follow meaning that you have to go where he goes, you have to do what he does, and you
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.640]   actually follow his steps.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.480]   All that the author of Hebrews has been teaching about Christology, all of it is really to
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.380]   bring us to this point so that the readers of Hebrews would change their behavior.
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.520]   Remember that what they were doing to cause him to drift.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.560]   It wasn't simply because the author of Hebrews was concerned.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.480]   So, you know what, they took a test and they just didn't know how to answer these questions.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.320]   You know, they didn't know how to answer Christology and about the identity of Jesus and how he
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.080]   fulfilled the tabernacle.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.560]   And so the point of this of the letter to Hebrews wasn't simply to get the doctrine
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.560]   right.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.520]   They needed to get the doctrine right so that they can change their behavior.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.240]   And if you read the New Testament, all of the letters are written in that format.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.780]   That would give us the correct doctrine.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.120]   And then it always leads to therefore.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.400]   Therefore, this is how you ought to apply this.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.920]   So you guys, you know, we just finished the study of the book of Ephesians chapter one,
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.000]   two, three, basically is Christology about salvation.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.800]   Chapter four, five, six was the application of that, right?
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.800]   Book of Romans.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.040]   We finished a while back, chapter one through eleven is about soteriology, about, you know,
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.160]   study of the doctrine.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.400]   And then chapter twelve and on is the application of that, right?
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.560]   And so book of Hebrews has heavily emphasized and in between it would give us these, these
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.000]   imperatives.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.680]   But we're at a, we're at a point where he's beginning to move away and maybe at the end
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.440]   part of Christology.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.640]   And then we're going to get into chapter eleven as examples of people who are living by faith.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.280]   And then chapter twelve and on, he's going to, he's going to just heavily emphasize what
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.640]   we ought to do.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.320]   So we can say that this section, the text that we're looking at now, is the beginning
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.040]   of that, right?
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.720]   Is the beginning part of introduction to the imperative.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.120]   Now that you have all the doctrines of Jesus, superiority of Christ, what does that mean
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.520]   outside of, you know, right?
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.000]   What is the proper response to that?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.520]   So there are three things that he, three imperatives that you'll see.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.000]   So in verse twenty-two, the first imperative is, "Let us draw near with sincere hearts."
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.780]   Let us draw near.
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.000]   And so I titled that "Reaching Up," right?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.440]   Our response first and foremost is to reach up.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.600]   Twenty-three, "Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope."
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.640]   To reach in, right?
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.840]   So first, to draw near to God.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.440]   Second, to hold fast to what we have.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.560]   And then verse twenty-four, "And let us consider how to stimulate one another."
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.680]   Is to reach out, right?
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.240]   So this, these three imperatives really is the outline of every imperative in the New
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   Testament.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.000]   It falls into these three categories.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.520]   So every preaching of the gospel leads to a challenge to reach up, reach in, and to
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.960]   reach out, right?
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.720]   So every imperative you see in the New Testament will fall into one of these three categories.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.640]   Draw near to God, persevere in your faith, right?
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.400]   And be sanctified, and then to reach out to other believers and to the world.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.720]   Reach up, reach in, reach out.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.400]   So that's the outline of the sermon for today.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.240]   I'm going to just get into the first two imperatives, and then the third one, the verse twenty-four
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.200]   and twenty-five, we'll get to next week.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.400]   Just so that I can give you a heads up.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.840]   We're going to spend most of our time with the first imperative, and then we're going
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.080]   to spend some time in the second one, and then again, third one, we'll get into next
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.300]   week.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.120]   So the first imperative, right?
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:07.040]   "Therefore," he says, "since we have confidence," and again, he's reminding us, this is something
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.320]   that he's been saying all along, "since we have confidence to enter the holy place by
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.320]   the blood of Jesus," in other words, since now the door has been opened, where it wasn't
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:22.480]   opened before, "by the new and living way which he inaugurated for us through the veil,"
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.760]   that is his flesh, and again, "since we have a great high priest over the house of God,"
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:32.280]   since all of these things that I've been saying is true, then our proper response, first and
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.640]   most important response is, "Let us draw near."
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.640]   Draw near.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:44.780]   Now, like I said, the first and most important response of every person who hears the gospel
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.180]   is to draw near to God.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.360]   That's his whole point.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.780]   Now how many of you have ever heard the term "inclusio"?
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.080]   It's not Italian, it's Greek.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.080]   Okay?
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.280]   It's basically a literary form of the New Testament where it begins a thought at one
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.280]   part of the letter, and then that thought kind of is concluded at another part of the
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.480]   letter, and usually the inclusio could be a very short text, but sometimes it could
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.960]   be a long text.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.800]   And usually the reason, how you know that that's the case is that you'll see almost
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:22.680]   verbatim the same words, the same phrase, same idea that started in one text, and then
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.960]   almost exact repeating of that happens at another text, which means the main point was
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.480]   introduced and then they gave the argument, and then they're giving the conclusion.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.980]   So this text is the end part of that inclusio.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:43.880]   The first beginning part of that happened in Hebrews chapter 4, 14 to 16.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.000]   And let me read it for you, and it's going to sound exactly like this text, because this
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.640]   is the beginning of this inclusio.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.520]   It says, "Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens,
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.600]   Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.520]   For we do not have the high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.880]   has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.020]   Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace so that we may receive
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.740]   mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:18.360]   So it almost, it almost is verbatim of what he is saying in this text, and so this idea
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:24.400]   is introduced to us in chapter 4, and so in other words, this is kind of like a conclusion
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.440]   of the point that he was trying to make, and then he's going to go into the imperatives
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.880]   and saying that this is how we ought to live.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.880]   Okay?
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.520]   So just so that you know the structure of what's going on.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.640]   And it helps us to understand the importance of what he is saying in this text, because
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.240]   it is the conclusion of everything that he's been saying.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:49.880]   And the most important part of this conclusion of all his argument was to draw near.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.440]   That's his main point, to draw near.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.560]   Not to simply admire from a distance.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.960]   Not to just give information.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.520]   In fact, that imperative to draw near is not unique to this text.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:09.840]   He repeats it over and over again in chapter 4, 16, chapter 7, 19, chapter 7, 25, chapter
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:15.640]   10, verse 1, chapter 10, 22, chapter 11, verse 6, chapter 12, verse 23.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:22.640]   Over and over again, as he is teaching Christology, he will conclude, or he will begin by saying,
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.640]   let us draw near.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.080]   We need to draw near.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.040]   Draw near.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.740]   He's saying this in particular in this context because the people were drifting.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.660]   They were moving away from Christ.
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.860]   So every little thing that he says, every Christology he gives, he says, we need to
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.580]   draw near.
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:47.900]   Remember, the very first things that he said to his disciples, he said to come.
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.480]   Come to me and I will make you fishers of men.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:57.420]   When he invited the sinners, first and foremost, before he sent them out, he said to come.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:02.140]   You know, typically when we think of Jesus' ministry, we think of at the end part of it,
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.340]   he has a great commission, he says to go, right?
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.340]   Go make disciples.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.820]   And so the mission of the church is to go.
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.180]   And so we have a lot of people who are like geared up to go.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.180]   We got to be a missionary.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.500]   We got to share the gospel.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.020]   And which is true, right?
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.660]   God called all of us to go.
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:22.260]   But remember, the very last thing that Jesus says to his disciples before he leaves in
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.820]   John chapter 15 is to stay.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.580]   The last of the seven I am statements, he says, I am the true vine.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:35.020]   And you cannot bear fruit unless you remain with me.
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.420]   And that word remain basically means to stay.
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:45.660]   That as I called you to myself, you cannot bear fruit unless you remain with me.
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.900]   So his last imperative that he gave his disciples before he gave the commandment to go is to
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.380]   remain, to continue to draw near to him, to be connected to him.
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.420]   Even the great commission.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.140]   If you remember, he says, go, therefore, make disciples of all the nations, baptizing
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.580]   them in the father, son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.580]   you.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.580]   And then how does it end?
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.380]   And lo, I am with you to the end of the age.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.420]   Right?
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.500]   So his commandment is to go.
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.520]   But in order to go, he says, you must stay.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.040]   You must remain.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:26.720]   So the most important imperative for any sinner or any believer of Christ is to continue to
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.660]   draw near to God.
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.980]   We cannot bear fruit.
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:40.180]   We can act, we can perform, we can work hard, but unless we are near Christ, we cannot bear
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.420]   fruit.
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.500]   He says to draw near, right?
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.780]   But he doesn't just say to draw near.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.940]   He says to draw near with confidence.
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:54.540]   I mean, it's one thing to just draw near to the throne of God, but it's just to come with
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.340]   confidence, with boldness.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:02.500]   And he mentions that same term all over Hebrews, but again, in the beginning of Inclusio, he
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.020]   said, "Hold fast our confession," right?
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.580]   "That we may draw near with," what?
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.700]   "Confidence."
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:13.620]   And then chapter 10, he begins, "Therefore, since we have confidence to draw near."
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:20.220]   So in both Inclusios, it says not only to draw near, but to draw near with confidence.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.380]   Beginning draw near with confidence.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:26.220]   Now, since we have this confidence, that this is what we ought to do.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:31.620]   Why do you think he emphasizes to be able to come with confidence?
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:38.740]   Imagine as a Jew, every part of the tabernacle in the Old Testament law, the old covenant,
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.500]   did not tell them to come.
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:46.500]   In fact, remember when God was given the covenant at Mount Sinai, remember what he told Moses?
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.080]   Tell these people not to come to the mountain.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:55.180]   If they come and touch even the outskirts of the mountain, they or even an animal touches
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.100]   this mountain, what did he say?
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.540]   You shall surely die.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.840]   Every part of the tabernacle was to teach them to not to casually come in.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.580]   They couldn't come in.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:12.040]   In fact, remember after he sets up the tabernacle, the very first offering wasn't given correctly,
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.980]   and they were consumed with God's fire, with judgment.
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:23.460]   So a Jew would have naturally thought, how can I possibly just enter in?
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:27.180]   That's what a Jew would have asked, you know, first question would have been asked.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.560]   How can I possibly just enter in?
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:34.180]   And that's why he's telling them, no, you're able to come in with confidence.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.260]   You're able to be bold.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260]   Consider that to today.
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:47.260]   Even non-Christians have this confidence based upon whatever it is that they heard about
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:51.220]   God, whatever it is that they heard about the gospel, for whatever the reason, confidence
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.180]   in the presence of God is just assumed.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.880]   And they say, yeah, me and God's like this.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:02.140]   You see rappers and movie stars and living in licentious sins, and they have no fear
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.140]   of God in their life.
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.140]   And they say, you know what?
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.140]   Thank my Lord.
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.380]   And God did this and God did that.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.820]   And so their relationship with God is just so casual.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.980]   It was just assumed.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:19.060]   And they have no idea what the scripture says that in their natural state, in as much as
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:23.300]   it is appointed for all men to die once, after this comes judgment, but they have no idea
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.180]   of this judgment.
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.900]   So entering into the presence of God is just assumed in this generation.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.020]   And I think that's the fault of the gospel preachers.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:39.700]   There's no fear of God and the gospel was preached without any kind of warning.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.020]   And so we have a generation of people who don't understand the holiness of God.
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.580]   And so there's this casual understanding.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.220]   Of course, you know, we entered the presence of God.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.220]   I entered this morning.
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.220]   I entered at night.
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.220]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.220]   Yeah.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.220]   And when I die, I'm going to enter, you know, so when I, when I see Jesus and I'm going
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:59.700]   to have dinner with him and I'm going to just, you know, have a conversation and, you know,
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.420]   you know, I'm going to, I'm going to do this with him.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:07.340]   It's just so casual because our understanding of who God is, isn't coming from scripture.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.380]   It's coming from our culture.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.860]   There's a reason why their author is telling them and reminding them and encouraging, encouraging
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:19.500]   these Jews that you're able to come with confidence.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:25.020]   But this confidence wasn't coming from just, just again, their experience or their background.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.420]   It was from their knowledge.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:32.180]   In Romans chapter 10, one through two, Paul describes a nation of Israel this way.
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:36.900]   Brethren, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.180]   He's talking to Paul's talking about the Jews.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.980]   For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.300]   They're passionate about God.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.860]   And I, I'm pretty sure that Paul's describing himself here.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.340]   Because Paul was a zealous man.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.380]   He was a passionate man.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.780]   And to the point of where he was, he was willing to kill people, right?
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.980]   And be killed, thinking that he was doing what was righteous in God's eyes.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:08.020]   He said, they have zeal like I did, but not in accordance with knowledge.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:13.460]   They had this confidence, but it wasn't correct because they had the wrong knowledge.
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:19.660]   See, this confidence isn't just, just boldness, or it's not just our personality, or it's
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.100]   just courage that we're able to muster up.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.020]   He says this confidence comes from correct knowledge of who God is.
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.020]   And that's why he starts by saying, he opened the door.
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.180]   He's our high priest.
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.540]   He shed his blood, the veil was torn.
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:37.580]   And so because of all of this that he has done, this knowledge gives us confidence to
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.420]   enter.
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:50.940]   It is lack of knowledge or lack of conviction over this knowledge that causes us to be timid.
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:56.780]   Years ago, when I was 19, when I first went to school, college, I thought I was going
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:57.780]   into business.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.820]   So I wanted to learn about real estate.
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.140]   I wanted to learn about sales.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:06.660]   And so I had a friend who was a peer, but he was into business.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.340]   His parents were already pretty wealthy.
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.700]   They had several factories.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:15.320]   And his dad actually owned a plastic bag printing company.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.620]   So he would supply those plastic bags with the Ralph logo and Lucky's.
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.860]   I don't know if they still exist today.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:25.300]   But he would have these contracts and they would print on the plastic bags.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.500]   So every once in a while, the dad would print something and it would be off.
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.860]   So it's not centered or something was off.
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.260]   And so basically it was trash.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.180]   So him and I would take these plastic bags that he couldn't give to them.
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.420]   And we would load it up in our vans or his van.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.820]   And we would drive around LA.
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.260]   And we spent a lot of time in South Central because that's where all the mom and pop shops
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.260]   were.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.620]   And the chain stores didn't want this.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.360]   So these personally owned stores would buy it.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.140]   So every time we sell, we would make about five, six bucks.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.320]   But this is, you know, the product was free.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.260]   So we would walk around from store to store and then we would try to sell some.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.360]   And he was a good salesman.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.660]   And I thought, you know, I was decent at sales.
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.600]   So we were making some money.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.540]   But I remember walking into this one particular Mexican market.
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.020]   And it was not a small one.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.940]   It was privately owned.
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.060]   But the probably size of it was probably like the size of our sanctuary.
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.620]   We went in there and my friend started talking.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.740]   He was using his broken Spanish and he was trying to sell these plastic bags.
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.340]   And we could tell immediately they were hostile.
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.260]   And my friend, we just wouldn't let it go.
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.940]   You know, and he said, "Nah, you gotta buy this.
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.940]   It's for free."
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.780]   And he's using his broken Spanish.
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.780]   And you could tell they're getting irritated.
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.540]   And we were probably there about 15, 20 minutes.
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.260]   And I kept on telling my friend, "Hey, let's get out of here.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.260]   They're not interested."
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:46.900]   Well, the manager got so ticked off, he literally picked up a broom and he chased us out of
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.500]   that store.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.980]   You know, and we were walking out.
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.100]   I said, "Dude, what are you doing, man?
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.100]   Clearly they don't want it."
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.100]   And he said, "Okay."
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.420]   So we walk out.
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.220]   We spend the next few hours walking around different stores.
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.020]   And then we're going back.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.300]   And to get back to our car, we had to pass by this store.
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.540]   So my friend has this great idea.
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.540]   He's like, "Let's go back in."
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.020]   I said, "What?"
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.460]   You know, we barely made it out alive.
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.460]   How are we gonna go back in?
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.460]   He said, "No, trust me."
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.460]   Right?
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.460]   So we walked back in.
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.820]   And obviously, you know, I kept my distance.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.380]   Just in case he gets stoned.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.380]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.740]   I don't want to be stoned with him.
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:21.740]   So I'm in the back.
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.460]   I'm watching him do his work.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.660]   And he's going at it with them.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.700]   They're yelling at him, "I told you to get out.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.140]   We're not interested."
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.420]   And he was using his broken Spanish.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.580]   And they were going back and forth.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:39.460]   And interesting enough, five minutes into it, the owner, I guess the owner opens up
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.760]   the window from the top and he's looking down, trying to chase us down.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.060]   And you could tell his demeanor changes all of a sudden.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.580]   And then he says, "How much?"
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.580]   So I was shocked.
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.940]   He went from, "Get out of here.
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.740]   You know, we're gonna throw you out," to, "How much?"
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.060]   As soon as he said that, I was like, "Whoa.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.060]   This guy's good."
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.060]   Right?
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.500]   I'm gonna make sure I'm friends with him for a long time.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.600]   This guy, I mean, he became a very successful businessman.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.220]   But he ended up unloading everything that we didn't sell that day.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.760]   And so because it was a big market, he bought everything that we had and we made more money
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.420]   on that one sale than we did all day, walking up and down.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.900]   So I was like thoroughly impressed with this guy.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.420]   And we're walking out.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.780]   And I asked him, I said, "How did you know?"
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.780]   Right?
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.100]   How did you know that this guy was going to buy it?
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.440]   He said, "Well, I didn't know, but I've been in this store before.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.700]   And they chased me out before."
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.260]   And I've sold to them before.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.260]   So he said, "This was a new.
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.140]   I didn't know any of this stuff."
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.140]   Right?
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.140]   He said, "Yeah."
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:50.780]   I mean, and from his personal experience, he says, "Sometimes you could tell if they're
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.180]   really serious or sometimes they just, you're just annoying.
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.120]   They didn't see if you would leave."
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.120]   You know?
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.020]   And wanted to see like if you're really serious about this sale.
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.540]   And so he was able to distinguish between the two.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.340]   And that was the difference between him and I.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.340]   I didn't know that.
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.140]   All I saw was their hostility.
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.340]   And I said, "Okay, we're done.
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.540]   You know, this is not worth it."
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.300]   Where he saw a great potential.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:16.980]   And the difference between his boldness and my timidness was his knowledge.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.140]   He knew something that I did not know.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:25.020]   Our confidence to enter the throne of grace is directly linked to our personal confidence
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.340]   of knowing who Jesus is.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:35.220]   If our confession is simply a verbal confession, it's just, we just admire him from a distance.
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.740]   There's reasons why people are timid.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:39.740]   They're timid to preach.
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:40.740]   They're timid to share.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.380]   They're timid to walk in their faith.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.140]   They're constantly concerned about what other people are going to think.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.140]   And a lot of that is directly linked to a lack of conviction, lack of confidence that
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.980]   we have in Christ.
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.700]   He says the confidence is based upon the blood of Christ.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.300]   The confidence is based on the new and living way.
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.820]   The confidence is based on the fact that we have a great high priest.
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:06.980]   And our personal conviction and boldness is directly linked to having a deep personal
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.820]   relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:15.340]   In fact, remember in Acts chapter 4, verse 13, the apostles are preaching with boldness
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.140]   in front of the same people who crucified Jesus.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:23.700]   These are the same disciples when Jesus is going to the cross, they were in fear and
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:30.000]   hiding and locked the doors and they disappeared because they were confused.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.140]   Why would our Messiah go to the cross?
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.340]   They didn't make any sense.
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:41.340]   But now after the resurrection, they recognize who he is, that even in death, they cannot
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.100]   contain him.
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.980]   And all of a sudden they're preaching the gospel with boldness.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:51.980]   And the people who are watching this and hearing this, this is what they say in observation,
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.580]   Acts 4, verse 13.
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:58.440]   Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John, again, the confidence of Peter and
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:04.500]   John and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were amazed and began
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:10.620]   to recognize them as having been with Jesus.
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.120]   Their boldness didn't come because of their education, their boldness didn't come because
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.740]   of their experience, their boldness came.
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:24.620]   And even the non-Christians recognized that their boldness came from being with Christ.
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:29.580]   It's our approaching Christ, it's our nearness to Christ, it's our strong near to Christ
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.460]   is what gives us conviction, what gives us confidence.
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:42.700]   So the first and foremost, the most important call of any sinner is to draw near to Christ.
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:49.620]   The most important call of any Christian, before you make disciples, before you go overseas,
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:54.500]   before you feed the poor, before you march for justice, first and foremost thing that
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:26:01.420]   God demands and calls us to apply is to draw near to him.
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:05.720]   We are of no use when we're not near Christ.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:11.300]   We are of no use, we cannot bear fruit according to scripture if we are not remaining in Christ.
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:16.300]   Doesn't matter how hard you work, doesn't matter how much you give, it doesn't matter
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.300]   what your experience is, it just doesn't matter.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.900]   Because true fruit comes from him.
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:30.060]   He says we are to draw near with sincere hearts, to draw near in full assurance with the hearts
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.740]   sprinkled and bodies washed by the blood of Christ.
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:40.500]   And all of this is simply to say, without hypocrisy, not pretending, not pretending
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:45.180]   on the outside and inwardly have nothing to do with Christ, that we have a reputation
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.700]   of godliness and you have no power in your life.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.020]   Because all of our connection with Christ is public.
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.540]   That all of our righteousness is for other people to see.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:01.460]   But when the cameras are not on, when people are not looking, you have no personal relationship
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.460]   with Christ.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.840]   That's all that this means.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:09.620]   With a sincere heart, with full assurance of faith, with our hearts, inner persons and
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:15.260]   our bodies, internally and externally, washed in the blood of Christ.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:19.820]   You see in Isaiah 29 verse 13, God says to the nation of Israel, "Then the Lord said,
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:26.940]   Because this people draw near with their words, they honor me with their lip service, but
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.820]   they remove their hearts far from me, and their reverence for me consists of tradition
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.180]   learned by rote."
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.500]   Meaning just, it's just tradition.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.700]   It's more superstition.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.700]   It's not real worship.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.040]   It's not really drawing near to God.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:48.380]   You see, when the Bible says and commands us to seek God with all our heart, it is not
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:52.060]   possible to seek God casually.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:56.500]   If you really understand what it is that you're seeking, if you really understand who it is
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:01.780]   that you're asking, either you seek him with all your heart or you're not seeking him at
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.780]   all.
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:08.300]   See, in Psalm 119 verse 10, "With all my heart I have sought you, do not let me wander from
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.780]   your commandments."
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:14.780]   Jeremiah 29 verse 13, "You will seek me and find me when you search for me with all your
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.740]   heart."
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:22.820]   When we draw near to God and seek God, we're not asking for lunch.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.260]   We're not asking for, you know, we have a hard relationship and can you fix that for
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.260]   me?
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.060]   You know, like we're not asking for a better job.
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.540]   I mean, again, not that he doesn't care about all of that stuff, but there's no urgency
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:42.900]   in any of that because, you know, if you have financial issues, get a job.
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.460]   Work harder, invest better.
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.420]   If you have relational issues, stop being selfish.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.540]   You know, work on your personality.
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.860]   There's like so many things that we can do and say, well, you know, there's things that
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:54.860]   I can apply.
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:29:00.180]   And so whenever we seek God, we seek God in things that we can do ourselves and then we
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.140]   just sprinkle Jesus on it, right?
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:06.260]   In the beginning and at the end and God, can you make this better?
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.740]   But we seek God for things that only he can give us.
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.380]   And only he is the author of life.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:22.500]   And so when we seek Christ, we seek him for life and nobody seeks God casually for life.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.660]   Just like a man who's drowning.
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:30.780]   If he recognizes the urgency of his situation, the desperateness of his situation, he doesn't
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:37.340]   simply ask, he doesn't simply ask for the rescuers to come and say, hey, hey, I'm drowning.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.940]   If you don't come in the next five minutes, I'm going to drown and die.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:45.620]   You will never see somebody who's drowning asking for help in that kind of manner because
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:48.520]   he recognizes his urgency.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.800]   He recognizes his desperate need.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.820]   So you will, if somebody is drowning, he recognizes that he will be, he will be yelling and screaming.
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.500]   He will do anything that he needs to do to get their attention because it is life or
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.500]   death.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.700]   Remember what Paul told Timothy?
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:09.140]   To watch your life and doctrine carefully and if you do so, you will save yourself and
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.420]   your hearers.
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.020]   Your life depends on it.
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:17.500]   It is not possible to seek God out and draw near to him casually.
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.660]   If you are seeking him casually, it's because you do not recognize what it is that you are
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:27.060]   asking and you do not know who it is that you're asking of.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:32.580]   By nature, drawing near to God is, requires urgency.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.220]   Not because God commands it, but that's the truth.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.860]   That's the fact.
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:44.020]   That's why in Joshua chapter 24 verse 15, Joshua says to the nation of Israel, if it
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:48.460]   is disagreeable in your side to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves today whom you
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.100]   will serve.
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:56.100]   Whether the gods which your father served with, which were beyond the river or the gods
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:01.740]   of the Amorites in whose land you are living, but ask for me and my house, we will serve
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.740]   the Lord.
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:10.780]   See, Joshua was tired of the Israelites who are going back and forth to serving the idols
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:16.020]   when it was convenient for them and then coming back to God when it was convenient for them.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.020]   So what Joshua is saying is you need to make up your mind.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.020]   Who are you serving?
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.420]   Who is your Lord?
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.420]   Who do you follow?
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:28.140]   See, I think one of the biggest challenges that we have in our modern day church, we
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:32.300]   have churches filled with people who never made up their mind.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.220]   They've decided to come to church.
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.180]   They've decided to maybe sign on the dotted line.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.380]   They've decided to become members.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.700]   They've decided to be identified as Christian.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:47.020]   They are admirers of Christ, but they're not followers of Jesus.
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.820]   That's what he's referring to.
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.100]   Choose you this day whom you will serve.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:56.660]   You can admire him from a distance, identify as a Christian, stand before the throne of
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:00.240]   God, and God says, "That had nothing to do with me.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.040]   You used me as superstition.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:08.620]   You used me as some vending machine to help you with your sorrow because you are lonely,
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.620]   because you were having a difficult time, because you were sick, because you were having
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.280]   business problems.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:18.340]   You wanted me to help you with your life, but you never surrendered your life to me.
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.940]   Choose you this day whom you will serve."
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.580]   First and foremost, drawing near to him.
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.300]   Do you know him from a distance?
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:32.820]   Is the only relationship that you have with Jesus is a corporate relationship?
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:37.820]   You know him in the context of a community, and so that gives you some sort of assurance
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:41.300]   that somehow you are in the presence of God?
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:46.020]   Well, that is not the Bible, the God of the Scriptures.
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:51.140]   The God of the Scriptures demand that if this is what we believe, the door was not open
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.140]   for us so we can admire it.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:33:00.660]   The way to the Holy of Holies was not open so that we can say, "That door is huge!"
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.100]   And we thank God that he opened the door.
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:11.060]   So maybe sometime in the future, if I want to visit, stick my feet in, go check it around,
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:16.180]   check to see, kind of like we're tourists wanting to see what it looks like, but we
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.020]   never go in.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.840]   We're not dwelling in the presence of God.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.220]   He is not our pursuit.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.820]   All we are are admirers, but we're not followers of Christ.
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:32.960]   See the first and most important imperative that every Christian needs to embrace and
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:37.240]   decide for ourselves is, "Am I following Jesus?"
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:41.860]   And again, I may sound like a broken record, the question is not, "Are you coming to church?"
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.740]   The question is not, "Are you a member of a community church?"
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:48.740]   The question is, "Are you following Jesus?"
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:53.180]   Is Jesus, his voice, his teaching, do you believe this?
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.580]   And are you following Jesus?
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.900]   And let me get to the second one, and the second one is not going to be as long.
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.740]   If that is your case, we draw near, and as we draw near, he says, "Let us hold fast the
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:05.740]   confession."
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:10.980]   He says, "Unswervingly, unbending, if this is what you believe, that we are to persevere."
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:15.340]   Hebrews 2, 1, "For this reason, we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard,
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.780]   so that we do not drift away."
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:24.340]   Man, you know what we need to do to drift?
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.200]   Nothing.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.880]   Do nothing.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.140]   If you're not clinging to Christ and actively drawing near to Christ, you're drifting, you
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.620]   just don't know it.
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.260]   You're already drifting.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.580]   Drifting doesn't require any effort.
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.800]   Here's what you need to do to drift.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:49.420]   Get a job, wake up early, go to work, get paid, and with that money, pay your bills,
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.340]   and with some of that money, enjoy yourselves.
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:35:01.700]   Come to church, serve a little bit, have fellowship, attend Bible study, take a little trip, donate
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:08.180]   a little money here and there, and then just casually walk along in life.
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.420]   And that's all you need to do is to drift.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.660]   That's all you need to do.
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:18.300]   If we're not actively pursuing Christ, you're already drifting.
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:20.860]   We just don't know.
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:25.660]   That's why he says to hold fast, do not bend.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:34.460]   We cannot fight for our opinion and so easily compromise with the truth.
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.660]   You know, we're willing to march, we're willing to stand up, we're willing to protest, because
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.380]   this is my political opinion.
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:47.900]   But when it comes to the truth of the gospel, where it's literally life and death, eternal,
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:53.280]   we're timid, we're quiet, we're submissive.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:58.180]   What he's saying is, with the truth, we should be bold.
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.740]   With truth, we should be confident.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:05.200]   With truth, we should be willing to sacrifice.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.740]   With our opinions, we should be gracious.
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:12.180]   With our opinions, we should be quiet.
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:16.820]   With our opinions, we should not be fighting.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:21.340]   But with the truth, he says to hold fast, do not bend, do not compromise.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:25.980]   1 Timothy 4, 2, preach the word, be ready in season and out of season, reprove, rebuke,
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:31.140]   exhort with great patience and instruction, do not turn from the word.
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:36.340]   Do not compromise, do not cut the sharp corners, do not only give them what's palatable, give
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:41.980]   them the truth, even if they don't like it, even if they get offended, even if you lose
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:42.980]   friends.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:47.680]   He said, do not turn from the word to the left or to the right, because true life is
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.380]   found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:56.380]   That's what he means by hold fast, no matter what the consequence, because God is faithful.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.700]   You know what God is faithful means?
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:02.260]   Because again, because of our cultural baggage, our false understanding of Christ, whenever
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.740]   we hear God is faithful, we automatically think God is merciful.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:06.740]   Right?
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.900]   Oh, God's going to be gracious.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.300]   What does faithfulness mean?
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.540]   To be consistent.
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.540]   You can rely on him.
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:22.100]   So a judge who is faithful will judge faithfully.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:27.660]   A police officer who is faithful isn't a police officer who just lets you off the ticket,
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.020]   you know, get you off all the time.
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.500]   No, he's a good police officer.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.500]   He's consistent.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.020]   You can rely on him.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:38.740]   So faithfulness simply means he is consistent.
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:43.620]   That's why he says we ought to take this seriously, hold fast this confession, because God is
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:48.820]   faithful and then he reminds us of his faithfulness in the very next section in chapter 10, verse
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:52.020]   25, 26 and 28.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:57.580]   The harshest and the most severe warning in the New Testament is found in the very next
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:03.300]   text after he says we ought to hold fast because he is faithful.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.620]   And then he describes his faithfulness in verse 26 of chapter 10.
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:12.220]   For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:17.820]   remains a sacrifice for sins, but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.580]   fire which will consume the adversaries.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:24.700]   Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimonies of two
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:25.980]   or three witnesses.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.860]   And he goes on and on and on.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.360]   God is faithful.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:35.340]   He is faithful to repentant sinners to forgive us our sins.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:40.660]   He is also faithful to judge us of all our unrighteousness who are unrepentant.
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:48.060]   The word glory, literal meaning of the word glory means to be weighty, to be serious.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:53.340]   That our worship before God, our presence to be able to draw near to him is never meant
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:55.260]   to be casual.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:56.740]   We don't come to God casually.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.980]   There's weightiness to what we do.
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.460]   There's weightiness to these words.
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:05.320]   If we hear it and we're kind of, you know, like I'll deal with it later.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.540]   It's because you have not seen his glory.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.180]   You do not know him.
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:13.700]   And that's why he says we ought to hold fast for dear life.
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:19.380]   We ought to anchor with Christ for dear life, to watch our life and our doctrine closely
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:24.240]   because if you do so you will save yourself and your hearers because our life depends
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.740]   on it and because he is faithful.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:34.100]   He will reward the repentant sinners and he will judge the unrepentant.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:41.820]   So there is a greater need in this world than social justice.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.060]   There is a greater need.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:52.900]   We can make this world a better place with no prejudice, no poor, no sex trafficking.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:57.020]   We can make this a better place with better politics, better economy.
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:04.900]   And at the end of all of that, all our effort and to create a great society for our children,
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.380]   our great grandchildren.
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:12.100]   But the Bible says that the end of all of that is judgment.
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.140]   End of all of that is judgment.
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:16.660]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.420]   God calls us to call out injustice.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.740]   God calls us to feed the poor.
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.120]   We ought to be compassionate.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:28.100]   We ought to stand up for those who don't have voices.
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:29.100]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:34.580]   It is the character of a Christian to be gracious and merciful.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:38.180]   But don't get our priorities mixed up.
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:43.580]   That in our priorities that we try to save a leg while the person is dying.
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:47.660]   Our priority is the gospel and it will always be the gospel.
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:53.100]   Until they come to Christ and they know Christ, this faithful God will carry out his mercy
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.240]   and his justice in this world.
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:01.660]   So as Christians who believe this, we need to first and foremost draw near.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:07.040]   We need to hold fast and we need to be the light in this world.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:13.520]   So my prayer again, with all the stuff that's going on around us, cling to the word of God,
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:18.900]   cling to the gospel, cling to Christ, that even though they may not understand that we
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.720]   make it very clear.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.560]   The wrath of God is being revealed against all unrighteousness.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:28.680]   The only hope for the wrath of God is the blood of Jesus.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   And I pray that we may be so deeply convicted that we would not drift.
