[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.040]   It truly is a blessing as we have our Sunday worship here

[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.320]   We're gonna come before our God singing this first song,

[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.800]   So please sing with us and really reflect on
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.620]   what we have in Christ that he spilled his blood

[00:06:49.100 --> 00:07:08.660]   - Good morning, everybody.
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.720]   All right.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.060]   Thank you, all two of you.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.480]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.420]   Now, I would like to take a moment
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.220]   to cover a few announcements for us.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.740]   One of the first announcements
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.020]   is just pertaining to our schedule.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.940]   If you noticed that we're gonna be trying
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.740]   to take a large group photo with everybody,
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.300]   and that's taking place at 12 sharp.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.220]   So please make sure that you do go
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.100]   and pick up your children for that photo.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.180]   Don't forget about them as you go over to the photo.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.020]   And what we're gonna be doing is heading out.
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.100]   There's a main fountain right at the center,
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.740]   and there's a large lawn there.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.060]   So we'll be headed out.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.660]   Once the small groups are over,
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.980]   we're gonna be just directing you.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.900]   So please make sure you pay attention to that.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.480]   But again, 12 sharp, we'll be headed out there.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.860]   Some announcements for us
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.620]   are pertaining to some of the things happening at church.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.780]   As a reminder, please sign up
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.880]   for the Intentional Wives Fellowship
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.680]   that's going to be taking place.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.820]   They'll be reading through the book,
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.020]   "This Momentary Marriage,"
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.920]   and meeting up in different times that'll be set,
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.860]   and then having fellowship over discussions.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.300]   So please make sure,
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.460]   if you'd like to participate in that, to sign up.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.740]   Also, as you guys know, soon on August 21st,
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.540]   we're gonna be having our church-wide
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.220]   cleaning and maintenance day.
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.340]   So if you'd like to lend a hand,
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.780]   please make sure you sign up on,
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.660]   the link is there on the Facebook or the app.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.500]   So sign up for that.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.820]   Again, it's happening Saturday, August 21st,
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.980]   starting from 8.30 a.m.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.640]   The next announcement I have for you is the FAM 245.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.600]   There's going to be a workshop
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   that's taking place on Saturday, August 28th, at 10.30 a.m.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.600]   And this is specifically for young families
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.720]   who have been married recently, starting from 2018.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.060]   So if you're in that category, and Ivat has gone out,
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.640]   please make sure you reply to that.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.200]   It's a workshop talking about how to think about our wealth,
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.920]   our stewardship, and the dangers of materialism.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.980]   So please make sure you sign up for that to participate.
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.540]   And the last announcement that I have
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.920]   is for the entire education department.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.180]   All the parents with children
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.500]   in our SOE education department,
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.780]   there's going to be a PTA meeting
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.040]   that's going to be taking place
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.080]   on Sunday, August 29th, at 2 p.m.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.980]   So this is a meeting that'll cover
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.440]   important projections for the next year,
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.380]   various changes of new teachers,
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.440]   and class divisions, et cetera, will be discussed,
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.960]   and you'll have an opportunity to come and meet
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.840]   the teachers that are going to be guiding those classes.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.840]   So please make sure you put that on your calendar.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.380]   It's a mandatory meeting for all the parents.
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.020]   And if you have questions or cannot make it,
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.980]   please be sure to message Pastor Peter Chang.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.620]   Okay, at this time, I'll lead us in a word of prayer,
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.420]   and we'll have an opportunity in a moment
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.120]   to submit our offering via the electronic format.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.520]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.520]   Heavenly Father, we are truly grateful to you.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.280]   God, as we continue just to think about
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.400]   your mercies over us, and even this entire topic
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.720]   of reconciliation, we know, God,
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.400]   that this is not a concept that we derived
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.640]   as something that would be nice for us.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.920]   God, you initiated all things towards us.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.480]   So we're so grateful that you're teaching us,
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.620]   and God, you have blessed us in such a way.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.400]   Lord, we're thankful that we're able to come to you
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   in worship, and we pray that you would bless this time.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.080]   Father, bless the time of hearing your word,
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.600]   cause our minds to be just rejuvenated,
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.240]   the thoughts and intention of our hearts
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.920]   to truly be sanctified.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.680]   And Lord, as we even think about giving our offering,
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.400]   we give with thankfulness in our heart,
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.120]   knowing, Lord, every single thing we have,
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.440]   we've received from your gracious hand.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.120]   And we pray, Father, God, that what we give
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.680]   would be just an expression of our gratitude,
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.560]   and what's more, we do pray that the offering
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.200]   would be used for your purposes,
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.280]   God, that it would be used for your ministry
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.600]   and your gospel.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.920]   Lord, we thank you for this time.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.880]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:43.360]   Well, good morning on this Sunday morning.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.960]   It's a pleasure to see you here today
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.840]   to be able to worship the Lord,
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.720]   not only in song, but also by going to his word.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.680]   And I wanna say from the depth of my heart
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.840]   as well as that of my wife's,
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.080]   how wonderful and kind and hospitable
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.240]   Brean has been to the two of us.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.280]   I told your pastor last night,
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.240]   if you find us dead in our motel room,
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.840]   it's because you killed us with kindness.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.120]   All right?
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.440]   All right, that's the reason why.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.000]   So you guys are the fault of it.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.600]   So you've been wonderfully hospitable
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.200]   and everyone I've met has been incredibly friendly.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.800]   I am so excited to be able to get to know you as a church,
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.200]   to get to know your pastoral staff,
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.600]   and I think some of the best days of Brean are yet ahead.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.640]   So I think that's really wonderful.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.480]   So welcome this morning.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.200]   We've been talking about biblical reconciliation
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.540]   and at the beginning of our conference,
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.840]   we said this is radically different
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.840]   than what is commonly referred to as conflict resolution
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.960]   because our goal is much more comprehensive
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.080]   than just merely resolving specific conflicts.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:05.080]   Our goal is oriented towards bringing about relationships
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:10.680]   that are better than before conflicts occur.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.040]   All right?
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.200]   And full and complete reconciliation
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.320]   so that there is a very tight unity
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.880]   within the body of Christ.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.280]   That doesn't mean that everybody in the body of Christ
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.320]   is gonna be your best friend.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.680]   It doesn't mean that.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.200]   What it does mean is that you treat everybody
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.300]   in the body of Christ as your best friend.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.200]   That's different, all right?
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.120]   And that's radically different
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.100]   because they are the same people
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.960]   that the Lord Jesus Christ died for
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.660]   and shed his blood for
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:54.660]   and that's the family that you're a part of forever.
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.940]   You know, this earthly family,
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.460]   earthly families are only temporary.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.400]   We're supposed to love our wives, love our husbands,
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.180]   love our children, all that is good and we understand
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.180]   but it's a very temporary family.
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.940]   You're sitting among people
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.400]   that are a part of forever family.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.020]   That transcends the earthly family.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:19.180]   Hence, Jesus talks about whoever leaves father, mother,
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.380]   wife, husband, children and follows me.
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.380]   That means that the spiritual family
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.260]   trumps the earthly family.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.020]   Every time, the spiritual family
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.000]   always trumps the earthly family.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.740]   And that's our devotion to Christ.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:39.060]   That's who we will be with for all eternity.
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.180]   We got a little teeny taste
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:45.780]   of worshiping the Lord in heaven this morning
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.140]   as we were singing.
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.020]   Man, just to listen to you all sing,
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.660]   I can get excited, I could just do this all day long.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.340]   All right, and not stop.
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.140]   So this is part of that little down payment
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.220]   of what it's going to be like in heaven
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.020]   with forever family.
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.720]   The people that you're sitting among
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.660]   are the type of people that are going to be
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.020]   your family forever.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.100]   Forever.
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.780]   That's really important.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.540]   So as we begin this last section,
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.660]   the first session we dealt with the issue of the heart.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.780]   We have to understand the heart.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.180]   The heart has to change before there's any kind
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.700]   of relationship change.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.940]   We talked about that.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.880]   We move to repentance.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.980]   Repentance is that agent that God has designed
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:38.300]   to bring about a fundamental change in our nature
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.420]   whereby we are different than before.
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.440]   So when I see that I've done wrong,
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.860]   when I've seen that I have hurt
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.100]   or caused a conflict with someone else
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.980]   and I realize that it is a sin,
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.140]   that I have to repent of that particular sin,
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:02.420]   and we said that repentance is a change of mind
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.980]   that is so complete that it leads to a change of life.
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.080]   That's repentance.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.100]   It's not just merely a change of mind,
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.420]   but it's a change of mind that is so complete
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.480]   that it leads to a change of life.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   It leads to a fundamental nature change in you.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.120]   We're no longer dogs, as we talked about.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.280]   We're no longer pigs.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.080]   Now the last thing that we need to deal with
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.080]   is the issue of forgiveness.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.320]   Remember how I said you need to bring to your session
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.520]   your safety belts, your crash helmets,
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.240]   and you need to add a flak vest for this session.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.300]   So hang on, we're gonna get into
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:48.100]   what does the Bible really say about forgiveness?
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.220]   What does the Bible say about it?
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.820]   All right?
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.980]   So let's begin with prayer.
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:58.980]   Gracious Lord, we need teachable hearts.
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.500]   We need to be disciples.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.780]   Disciples are learners.
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:11.660]   And I pray that through the work of the Spirit of God
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.960]   in our hearts this morning,
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.400]   you will help us to be learners,
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:24.840]   especially when it comes to the topic of forgiveness.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:30.800]   So we commit our time to you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.160]   What is forgiveness?
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.520]   That's a real critical question, right?
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.500]   What is it indeed?
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.880]   So as we deal with this third area,
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.720]   we need to understand it.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.360]   What is forgiveness?
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.920]   And you're gonna find out if you are able
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.720]   to examine this more fully,
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.040]   a full biblical theology of forgiveness,
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.080]   that forgiving people are always
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.960]   and first and foremost humble people.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.440]   If there is pride in your life,
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.400]   you're gonna have a difficulty
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.080]   practicing biblical forgiveness,
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.940]   if there's pride in your life.
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.640]   But if you are genuinely humbled
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.880]   as a result of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.160]   in other words, he has humbled your heart,
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.640]   that as you come and bring your life
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.480]   to the shadow, to the base of the cross,
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.360]   there is no place for pride there.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.720]   There is no place for arrogance there.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.120]   There's only a place for humility
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.260]   because we are entirely undeserving
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.840]   of what Christ did on the cross
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.840]   with his atoning sacrifice for our sins for all time.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.360]   No one deserves it.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   No one even comes close to deserving such a thing.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.680]   And that alone, when you sit at the foot of the cross
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.660]   and you look up and see that Jesus Christ died for you,
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.260]   should be humbling from the very beginning.
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:13.600]   So what is forgiveness from a biblical standpoint?
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:18.840]   The primary Greek term that's translated forgive
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.840]   is the word ephiemi, ephiemi.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.360]   It means to send away or to release.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:30.760]   So in reference to sin, it actually means to pardon.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.840]   That's what it means, to pardon.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.640]   But forgiveness has also rightly been described
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.600]   as a promise, why?
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.400]   Because when God forgives,
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.400]   he promises that he will never hold our sins against us.
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.660]   When God forgives, he promises
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.620]   he will never hold our sins against us.
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.760]   Now as we practice forgiveness,
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.220]   I want you to take your Bible just for a moment
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.720]   and let's go over to Ephesians chapter four in verse 32.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:13.620]   I want you to see this in Ephesians chapter four, verse 32,
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.980]   that all of our forgiveness of one another
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.980]   is predicated upon the way in which God has forgiven us.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.180]   Now did you hear me on that?
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.160]   All of our forgiveness of one another
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:31.260]   is predicated upon the way in which God has forgiven us.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.540]   Ephesians chapter four, verse 32,
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:39.540]   be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:44.360]   just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.360]   Now you see that word tenderhearted?
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.500]   Literally, remember we talked about this before
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.860]   when we talked about the heart.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.380]   That really is in the Greek language tender bowed.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.960]   All right?
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.460]   It's tender bowed, forgiving one another
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:05.640]   just as God in Christ has forgiven you.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.120]   So we're supposed to forgive one another
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.640]   as we have been forgiven.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.120]   Go over two books to Colossians chapter three in verse 13.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.520]   He comes back to this again.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.380]   Bearing with one another, he says, forgiving each other.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.500]   Whoever has a complaint against anyone
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.500]   just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:34.540]   Again, our forgiveness of one another,
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.100]   get this in your thinking,
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.340]   our forgiveness of one another is predicated
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:43.420]   on the fact that we have been forgiven
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.740]   an entire lifetime of sin.
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.980]   Okay?
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:50.580]   That's predicated upon that.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.100]   If you don't understand that,
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.060]   then you don't understand biblical forgiveness.
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:30:00.060]   We're supposed to forgive the way that God has forgiven us.
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.280]   He has forgiven us.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:08.480]   Well, let's take a look at this just for an example.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.280]   What has God done in his forgiveness with us?
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.560]   Let's go back to the Old Testament to understand this.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.440]   Let's go back to Jeremiah chapter 31.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.400]   For a moment, Jeremiah chapter 31,
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:25.400]   and here we are interested in verse 34.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.280]   Now look at this carefully.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.880]   And by the way, the immediate context
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.920]   of this particular verse has to do
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.840]   with the coming new covenant,
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.000]   which is speaking of the covenant
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.820]   that the Lord Jesus Christ brought.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.840]   So that's the context here of this verse.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.220]   And it says in the coming new covenant,
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.800]   it says in verse 34, they will not teach again,
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.240]   each man his neighbor, and each man his brother,
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.320]   saying, know the Lord, for they will all know me,
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.360]   from the least of them to the greatest of them,
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.020]   declares the Lord, for I will forgive their iniquity,
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:02.880]   and their sin I will remember no more.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.240]   Now listen to that.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.160]   Now in order to understand this,
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.600]   you've got to understand something about the idea
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.600]   of passive and active forgetting.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.040]   All right?
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.240]   Because God says their sin I will remember no more.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.280]   Within the context of the new covenant,
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.640]   this coming new covenant, this was not something
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.540]   that was a part of the Abrahamic covenant directly.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.400]   That was not spoken of there.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.880]   It wasn't spoken of in the Mosaic covenant,
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.480]   but it is talked about in relationship to the new covenant.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.360]   It is talked about there, where God says,
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:45.360]   I will remember their sins no more.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.280]   Now, that's very important.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:53.280]   There's a difference between active and passive forgetting.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:59.640]   I have forgotten a lot of stuff in the past.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:05.780]   It's really bad, gentlemen, when you forget your anniversary,
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:13.120]   because you just don't use that information all the time.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.680]   When you don't use information, you forget it, right?
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.800]   If you were to ask me several years ago where I lived
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:26.800]   and what my phone number was back 35, 40 years ago,
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.840]   it would be really hard for me to recall my phone number
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.640]   and exactly what my address was,
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:37.640]   but when I lived in specific locations back in the Midwest,
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.720]   it would be very, very difficult for me to remember that.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.320]   I'd probably need a little bit of prompting,
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.360]   and once I got a little prompting,
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.240]   then I, oh, yeah, yeah, then I recall
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.320]   that unused information.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.880]   Now, why have I forgotten all that?
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.640]   Because I don't use it anymore, right?
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.700]   I don't use that information anymore,
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:58.040]   so I have passively forgotten that information.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.220]   Now, listen, God does not forget anything.
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.600]   He doesn't forget anything.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:09.080]   God has not forgotten your sins.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.960]   If God forgets his people's sins,
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.520]   then he's forgotten most of his Bible
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:20.160]   because most of his Bible is about his people's sins.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:25.000]   God does not passively forget our sins.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.520]   He doesn't do that.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.520]   What does he do?
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:32.320]   He actively, there's a difference here,
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.040]   and this is active Hebrew voice,
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:40.040]   he actively does not remember our sins against us any longer.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.240]   That is a promise.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.720]   Are you following me?
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:53.720]   He actively does not remember our sins against us
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.760]   any longer.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.080]   He doesn't passively forget them.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.640]   He doesn't forget anything.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.200]   God is omniscient.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.840]   He remembers everything.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:08.520]   But he actively does not remember, in this sense,
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.780]   our sins against us any longer.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.880]   Corrie ten Boom used to say, "God takes our sins,
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.280]   "plants them in the deepest part of the sea,
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.300]   "and puts up a no fishing sign."
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:24.340]   He actively does not remember our sins against us
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.180]   any longer.
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:28.340]   Go over to Isaiah chapter 43.
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:32.500]   Isaiah chapter 43 and verse 25.
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.680]   Now, notice what God says here.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:39.280]   Isaiah 43, 25, "I, even I, am the one
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.600]   "who wipes out your transgressions for my own sake,
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.000]   "and I will not remember your sins."
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.740]   Now, here's a different prophet.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.480]   This is the prophet Isaiah.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.740]   The context, however, is the same as that of Jeremiah 31,
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:57.500]   and that is he's talking about the new covenant.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.640]   Understands that we have sins,
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.700]   but when we are forgiven under the new covenant,
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:07.500]   they are not held to our account any longer.
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:13.500]   This is a promise that God makes.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.960]   He goes on record saying,
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.720]   "I will not hold your sins against you."
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:27.520]   Now, if God held even one sin against you,
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.180]   you have no hope of heaven.
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:34.500]   If he held even one sin against you,
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.460]   there would be no hope whatsoever,
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.940]   because God is absolutely holy.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.620]   He's absolutely pure in everything that he does,
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:49.960]   but he does not hold any of our sins against us.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.120]   If you have repented of your sins,
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:57.860]   you have bowed your knee to Jesus Christ
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.380]   as your Lord and Savior.
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:05.380]   Your sins are no longer held according to your account.
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.820]   Man, we all at that particular point
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.320]   ought to be charismatics.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:18.140]   All of our sins are taken care of for all eternity.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:22.660]   He doesn't hold any of them against us.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:25.360]   He goes on public record saying,
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.560]   "I will not remember their sins any longer."
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:35.540]   Now, if we're gonna forgive one another,
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.900]   and Ephesians 4:32 and Colossians 3:13 says
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:44.340]   we have to do this the way in which we have been forgiven,
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:51.380]   then now it's important for us to do the same thing.
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:58.740]   We now go on public record saying
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:04.420]   to whoever has offended us and sought our forgiveness,
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:09.860]   "I will not remember that sin against you any longer.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.460]   "I'll not do that."
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:18.920]   This is what God has done for us in salvation.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:23.140]   Man needs forgiveness from God
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:29.220]   both before we're saved and after we're saved.
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:34.340]   The forgiveness needed before salvation
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:38.580]   is what theologians call judicial forgiveness
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:43.260]   because prior to being saved, God is our judge.
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:47.860]   And our primary relationship to him is that of judgment.
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:49.460]   And he stands in judgment.
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.680]   The vast majority of people on the planet,
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.280]   God will be their judge.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.700]   Before they become a believer, God will be
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:03.400]   because he is an absolute, holy, just,
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:08.180]   and absolutely purely righteous God.
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.440]   He will be their judge.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:15.860]   So what we need prior to salvation is judicial forgiveness.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:20.420]   Theologians talk about this, judicial forgiveness.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:26.500]   But the forgiveness needed after we become a believer
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:32.420]   changes because God is no longer our judge.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.620]   God is our father.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:42.780]   So that's what theologians now call parental forgiveness.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:46.880]   Parental forgiveness.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.880]   Because God is now our loving, heavenly father
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:57.140]   who wants to free us from the temporal discomfort
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.340]   of his chastening.
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.140]   And that's what he does.
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:09.100]   So prior to salvation, we need judicial forgiveness.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.500]   After salvation, we need parental forgiveness.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:17.140]   After we're saved and we sin against God,
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.500]   he doesn't kick us out of his family,
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.440]   but he will bring chastisement.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:30.540]   He will bring discomfort, difficulty,
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:36.140]   hardship, and trials, not to cause us to pay for sins
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.940]   because our sins have already been paid for,
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.360]   past, present, and future.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.780]   Hebrews chapter 12, verses seven through 11
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.980]   makes it very clear he does this
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:51.500]   for the purpose of perfecting holiness in our lives.
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.420]   That's why he brings the discomfort.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:59.880]   So we need, after salvation,
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.880]   we don't suffer as Christians to pay for our sins.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:09.640]   I mean, I cannot tell you how many times
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:13.440]   I've had Christians say that to me in counseling.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.200]   You know, they explain all the difficulties
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.040]   and all the hardship that's going on in their life
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.760]   and all the losses that have occurred
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.240]   and the trials and the setbacks,
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.560]   and they describe all this, and then they'll look at me
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.160]   sometimes with tears running down their face,
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.400]   and they'll say to me, you know, is God punishing me?
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.780]   No, you know why?
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.880]   Because he poured out all of his punishment
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.480]   on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.560]   That's your savior.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.920]   He's not punishing you, then what is he doing?
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:48.280]   God's discipline in your life after you become a Christian
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.440]   is not punitive, it's corrective.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:55.260]   There's a huge difference between those two.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.380]   You don't pay for any sins, 'cause Christ paid for it all.
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.480]   We're not Roman Catholics.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.120]   Roman Catholics believe, oh yeah,
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.940]   Jesus paid for some of our sins,
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:10.460]   but I have to add my sufferings to Jesus' sufferings.
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.600]   I have to pray the rosary, I have to continue to go
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.600]   to mass on a repeated basis, I have to go
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.700]   to the confessional on a regular basis.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.680]   I have to pay so many indulgences so long
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.080]   in order for me to add my sufferings to Christ's sufferings
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.960]   to have all of my sins covered.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.440]   We're not Roman Catholics.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.920]   We don't add anything to what Jesus Christ did.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.620]   Christ paid for it all.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.080]   How about that, huh?
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:43.040]   What news could be better than all of your sins
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.960]   fully and completely paid for at the cross of Jesus Christ?
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.440]   So we don't pay for anything.
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.980]   'Cause Christ paid for it all.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.600]   Then why do we go through difficulty?
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.400]   To make us more like his son.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:04.860]   To perfect us in holiness.
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.520]   That's why we go through the difficulties.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.600]   That's why we go through hardship.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:14.440]   That's why we do that.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.120]   But God still forgives us.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.560]   He still forgives us.
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.040]   So if our forgiveness of one another is predicated
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.480]   upon what God has done for us,
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:30.360]   then we need to be ready to do the same thing.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:35.340]   What does that really mean when it comes to our forgiveness?
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:38.540]   Let me highlight three key things that that means.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:44.640]   When it comes to actively not remembering
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.620]   another person's sin against them,
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.020]   like God has done for us,
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:56.380]   then we need to do that for other people.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.580]   That means at least three things.
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.540]   Number one, it means this.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:05.060]   I will not remind you of this sin in the future
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:09.260]   unless it would be absolutely necessary for your good.
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.900]   I'm not gonna throw this up in your face in the future
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:17.900]   and somehow hold that against you.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:22.700]   When I promise to forgive you, it's settled.
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.420]   It's settled.
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.260]   I'm not gonna throw this up in your face
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.140]   when I get upset with you again.
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.940]   We're putting this behind us.
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:37.940]   I'm not gonna go on some kind of archeological dig
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:41.880]   and bring up your past faults.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:47.440]   We are to forgive one another just as God has forgiven us.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.740]   So when we grant forgiveness to someone,
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.060]   we're promising that we will not remember
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.620]   their sins against them,
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.140]   much the same way that God has done
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.580]   in Jeremiah 31, 34 and Isaiah 43, 25.
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:04.180]   That means that we will never use their sin against them.
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:06.820]   So practically, we're saying,
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.940]   I will not remind you of this sin
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:13.460]   unless it would be absolutely necessary for your good.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:19.360]   Forgiven sin is only brought up to help, never to hurt.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:24.640]   Basically, I'm not gonna bring it up.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.520]   I'm not gonna be historical.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.000]   I'm not going to keep records.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   When I promise to forgive someone, that's a settled issue.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.060]   The second thing that means is this,
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.380]   that I will not mention it to anyone else
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.480]   unless it would be absolutely necessary.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.600]   That is for your good.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.020]   I will not mention it.
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.780]   I'm not gonna roll around and talk about it
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:55.900]   behind your back.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:59.460]   I'm not gonna dwell on it and become
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:04.540]   a type of person who will gossip
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:09.260]   about your particular sin to my friends or family members
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:11.440]   or other people who are in the church.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.180]   I'm not gonna talk about your sin.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.300]   This is a settled issue.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.300]   When I forgive someone, I'm going on public record
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.980]   the way that God has, saying,
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.260]   I'm not gonna bring this up to you.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.540]   I'm not gonna bring this up to other people.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:27.560]   And the exceptions to this would be
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.340]   when maybe there's a life or death situation
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.300]   or a wanted criminal is involved
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.820]   or when a pedophile wants to work in the church nursery.
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.000]   This becomes an issue.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.300]   But again, it's for the broader welfare
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.820]   of the body of Christ.
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:43.860]   But the idea is, number one,
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.540]   I'm not gonna bring this up to you.
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.020]   I'm not gonna bring it up to other people.
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:52.660]   And the third one, and probably the most difficult one
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:56.820]   of all of this, is that to forgive someone
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:01.820]   means to promise that you're not gonna allow
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:04.300]   your mind to dwell on it.
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:08.480]   You're not gonna allow your mind to dwell on it.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:13.880]   Now, this is gonna be the hard one
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.340]   because we wanna do that.
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.700]   When somebody is sent against us,
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:19.840]   we wanna oftentimes in self-pity
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.500]   and out of personal hurt and difficulty and hardship,
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.600]   we wanna be able to think about it
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.220]   and say, look at what they've done to me.
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.560]   Look how they have hurt me.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:36.560]   And then I become bitter and I become resentful
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.720]   and I become angry on the inside.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:45.720]   No, no, no, I promise I'm not gonna dwell on that sin
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.720]   in my own heart and mind.
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.920]   When I forgive you, I'm making that promise.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:56.880]   So basically, going on record,
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.640]   the way that God is going on record
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.200]   in terms of forgiving us, when we go on record
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.160]   with someone else, it means three things.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.640]   I'm not gonna bring it up to you,
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.200]   I'm not gonna bring it up to others,
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.200]   and I'm not gonna bring it up to myself.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.320]   That's what it means.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.720]   I'm not gonna bring it up to you,
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.240]   I'm not gonna bring it up to other people,
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.220]   and I'm not gonna bring it up to myself.
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:21.220]   When I forgive you, I'm making that particular promise.
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:29.040]   Now, this is really important to understand
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:33.080]   because these three things are critical.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:38.080]   We said that forgiveness means to send away,
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:43.500]   to release, it means to pardon in this case.
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:48.500]   And so the best definition of interpersonal forgiveness
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:52.640]   in conflict reconciliation is this.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:56.320]   It is a promise of a pardon.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:00.940]   It is a promise of a pardon.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.580]   That means these three things.
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:05.680]   I'm not gonna bring it up to you,
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:06.840]   I'm not gonna bring it up to others,
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.320]   and I'm not gonna bring it up to myself.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:14.000]   I am promising to pardon you.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.880]   I am going to forgive you.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.080]   Why?
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:24.080]   Because I have been forgiven an entire lifetime of sin.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:29.120]   I have been forgiven an entire lifetime of sin.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:34.580]   Now, the real critical question,
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:38.860]   and this is where it starts to get a little bit harder,
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:44.700]   is the question, whom should we forgive?
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:50.100]   That's a really big question.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:53.460]   Very simple to state, very hard to answer.
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:56.620]   Whom should we forgive?
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.060]   Wow.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   Some passages in Scripture clearly imply
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:09.900]   that we can only forgive those who ask
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.540]   for forgiveness and repent.
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:15.660]   Luke 17, verses three and four.
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:18.340]   We're gonna go there a little bit later.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:22.140]   While others seem to imply that we should forgive everyone
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:26.400]   who sins against us, whether they ask for it or not.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.140]   Mark chapter 11 and verse 25.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:36.040]   So how do we understand this apparent discrepancy
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.200]   in Scripture?
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:42.400]   How do we clarify, on the one hand,
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.840]   we're only supposed to forgive those who ask for it,
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.800]   Luke 17, but on the other hand,
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.340]   we're supposed to forgive anyone of anything,
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:53.200]   Mark 11, 25.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.880]   It seems like Scripture is teaching us
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.640]   two different things, and they seem to be contrary.
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:05.140]   Perhaps the best way to make a distinction
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:10.000]   is from a theological standpoint
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   between what is referred to as transactional forgiveness
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.120]   and attitudinal forgiveness.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:22.300]   And let me explain the theology behind this.
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:26.520]   Transactional forgiveness and attitudinal forgiveness.
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:32.500]   Or you could say reconciliation versus release.
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:38.640]   Reconciliation versus release.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.640]   So let me look at those two things in Scripture
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.400]   to help you to understand them.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:50.080]   The first one has to do with the attitude of forgiveness.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.840]   The attitude of forgiveness.
[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:58.620]   Even though you may not be able to fully reconcile
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:01.580]   with everyone who sins against you,
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:06.420]   your attitude towards them should never be one of anger,
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:11.360]   bitterness, resentment, or ill will of any kind.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.540]   No malice.
[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:17.400]   You should treat them very kindly and graciously.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:21.400]   We talk about that in Romans chapter 12, verses 17 through 21.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:24.500]   You're commanded to love everyone.
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:27.040]   Luke 6, 27 through 35.
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:30.140]   So you've got to desire their best,
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:33.700]   which means that you're going to do everything
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:37.900]   that you can to bring them to repentance,
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:43.340]   and you'll always be ready to reconcile.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:46.380]   Why?
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:50.920]   Because that's the way God is with us.
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:54.700]   Now take your Bible again.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.880]   Let's go over to Psalm 86 in verse five.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.380]   Psalm 86 in verse five.
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:03.180]   And some translations,
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:04.920]   I don't know what translation you're using,
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:08.560]   so let me read from the New American Standard version,
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.460]   Psalm 86 in verse five,
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:18.180]   which talks about the fact that for you, Lord, are good
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:23.140]   and ready to forgive.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:25.260]   You see that?
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.900]   You're ready to forgive.
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:32.900]   God stands ready to forgive anyone of any sin.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.900]   And it goes on and says,
[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:38.220]   "An abundant and loving kindness to all who call upon you."
[00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:41.220]   And in fact, you take a look at the Hebrew phraseology
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.220]   of this, to all who call upon you,
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:47.580]   that's a synonymous phrase to repentance.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:50.120]   Every time you see that in the Old Testament,
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.900]   it means to call upon the Lord means to repent.
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:54.980]   To call upon the Lord means to repent.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:59.980]   So God is ready to forgive all those who repent,
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:03.580]   who call upon him.
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.900]   He's always ready to do that.
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.500]   It's one of the best ways you can translate that verse.
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.900]   That's really key.
[00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:12.260]   Let me read it again in verse five.
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:16.540]   For you, Lord, are good and ready to forgive
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.100]   an abundant and loving kindness to all who call upon you.
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:21.060]   In other words, to all who repent,
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:22.500]   our God is ready to do this.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:25.540]   So in a similar way, if God is ready to do this
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:28.860]   all the time, we need to be like him,
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.660]   ready to forgive anyone of anything.
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:33.420]   Wow.
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:40.380]   And that loving attitude has sometimes been called
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:44.880]   by theologians forgiveness of the heart.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:48.980]   Forgiveness of the heart.
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:53.540]   It's also been called vertical forgiveness
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:59.660]   because this type of forgiveness is always mentioned
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:06.220]   in scripture only within the context,
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:08.620]   listen to this, of prayer.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:15.260]   It's always listed in the context of prayer.
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:17.540]   Vertical forgiveness, attitude of forgiveness
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:22.900]   is always within the context of prayer.
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:30.700]   It is something that you do before God
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:33.860]   that enables you to have a right attitude
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:35.300]   towards that individual.
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:39.800]   Let me give you a few illustrations of this.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:43.620]   For example, in Mark chapter 11, verse 25,
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:44.980]   and whenever you stand praying,
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:48.760]   forgive if you have anything against anyone.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.120]   Now, when you take a look at that,
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:56.960]   Jesus is using this as an illustration
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.540]   of a man going to the temple to pray.
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:06.440]   If you have anything against anyone,
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:10.420]   Jesus says you need to forgive him.
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:15.360]   Whenever you stand praying, forgive if you have anything
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.180]   against anyone so that your father also
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.120]   who is in heaven will also forgive you
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.400]   and your transgressions.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.760]   So who's present?
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.720]   Here's a man who's gone to the temple to pray.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:28.800]   Well, it's only God is present and the man is present,
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.200]   but the offending party's not there.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.960]   So it's only you and God.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:36.760]   So it's only a vertical thing.
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:39.920]   In other words, in our heart,
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:45.540]   when he says you need to forgive
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:48.720]   if you have anything against anyone,
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.920]   this is the very thing that sets the conditions
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.280]   for all of forgiveness in our life.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:00.280]   Our heart should be ready to forgive anyone of anything
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:05.240]   the way that God is ready to forgive.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:08.800]   In Psalm 86 in verse five.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:14.320]   We can see this, another illustration of this
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:17.320]   is in Luke chapter 23 in verse 34.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:20.600]   This is Jesus on the cross.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:25.580]   And Jesus is saying, "Father, forgive them
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:28.740]   "for they do not know what they are doing."
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.500]   Now there are a lot of people who look at that particular
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.180]   verse and say, "Well, you see, Jesus is forgiving
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:37.500]   "those people that have crucified him on the cross.
[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:40.120]   "He's forgiving them in this prayer."
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.200]   No, he's not.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.960]   Read it carefully, Jesus is not forgiving them.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:49.340]   He's praying that they might be forgiven.
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:52.220]   That's what he's doing.
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:53.320]   He could have forgiven them.
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.240]   He could have hung on the cross and said,
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.280]   "I forgive you, and I forgive you,
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.000]   "and I forgive you, and I forgive you."
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.260]   But he doesn't do that.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:03.340]   He prays that they might be forgiven.
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.240]   Why?
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:06.680]   Because none of them have repented.
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:10.860]   Now are you ready for this?
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:14.700]   Fasten your seat belts and put your crash helmets on.
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:17.880]   Nowhere in the Bible does it ever say
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.400]   or teach the concept,
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:24.960]   I hope you're following me here,
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:29.920]   nowhere in the Bible does it ever teach the concept
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.540]   of unconditional forgiveness.
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:34.120]   Nowhere in the Bible.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:36.560]   Doesn't teach that.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.300]   Where's that come from?
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:42.320]   It comes from actually contemporary psychology
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.140]   because it's a therapeutic step.
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:48.120]   Where it's just supposed to unconditionally forgive people,
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:50.440]   whether they've repented of their sin or not.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:53.160]   Jesus doesn't do that.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.540]   There's not gonna be a sole individual in heaven
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:57.820]   who hasn't repented.
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.000]   That's part of the condition.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.600]   There's not gonna be anyone in heaven
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:06.060]   whose Christ's blood hasn't paid for their sin.
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:07.640]   That's part of the condition.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:13.080]   No such thing as unconditional forgiveness.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:16.620]   That's taught in contemporary psychology today
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:20.140]   as a means to help people feel better about themselves.
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:22.100]   When Stephen was being stoned,
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:26.700]   you remember that episode,
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:31.700]   he prays that the ones that are stoning him to death
[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:38.860]   will be forgiven.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:42.180]   He doesn't forgive them.
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:43.420]   He could.
[00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:48.840]   And by the way, did you know that you and I here today
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:51.540]   are a direct answer to that prayer?
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:54.400]   Why?
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:58.260]   Because one of the men stoning him to death
[00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.340]   was a man by the name of Saul.
[00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:05.320]   Saul later on becomes Paul.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:09.900]   Paul becomes the primary apostle to the Gentiles,
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:11.620]   and hence we're here.
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:15.740]   Stephen's prayer as he's dying,
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.940]   we're a direct result of that.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:21.640]   He prays that they might be forgiven.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:26.380]   Jesus' prayer on the cross when he hung there.
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:28.480]   And by the way, his prayers were always answered
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:31.340]   because his prayers were always in complete alignment
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:32.940]   with what God wanted.
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:34.020]   Father, forgive them.
[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:37.460]   And by the way, God answers that prayer in Acts chapter two
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:40.480]   because there is massive repentance
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:43.120]   in the city of Jerusalem.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:47.840]   Massive repentance in the city of Jerusalem.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:52.520]   So Father, forgive them,
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.520]   for they do not know what they're doing.
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:58.280]   Or we go to Matthew chapter six.
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.280]   This is all attitudinal forgiveness here.
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.320]   Or Luke chapter 11 in verse four,
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:08.940]   where it says, where Jesus teaches the disciples prayer,
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:12.660]   and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.860]   forgive everyone who's indebted to us.
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.440]   This is vertical forgiveness.
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.340]   This is attitudinal forgiveness.
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.680]   Help us set our hearts right
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.980]   so that we will be ready to forgive
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:27.620]   anyone who sins against us
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.520]   if they repent.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:35.400]   So if you conclude from those verses and others
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.200]   concerning the love and graciousness of the Lord,
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:42.080]   then any time someone wrongs you,
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.040]   you should pray to God in this way.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:50.040]   Father, you know what has happened between me and so and so.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:55.280]   Help me not to be angry or bitter at him or her,
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.600]   nor to seek revenge in any way.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.600]   Help me to love him or her and desire only their good.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.640]   Please work in their heart and bring them to repentance
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.640]   so that we can have a reconciled relationship.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.020]   That should be our prayer.
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:25.720]   For a believer that may involve a confrontation,
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:28.200]   according to Matthew 18, and for the unbeliever
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.240]   it would involve witnessing to him if possible.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:36.080]   As Ephesians 4:32 says, and be kind to one another,
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.600]   tenderhearted, forgiving one another
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.320]   just as God has forgiven you.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:48.920]   Now, that's the thing that sets the stage
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.060]   for all of forgiveness.
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:53.800]   It's the very thing that conditions our heart
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.960]   and makes our heart ready to forgive
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:01.960]   anyone who sins against us, no matter what that sin may be.
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:07.280]   Which now brings us to transactional forgiveness.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:14.000]   Transactional forgiveness is this.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.020]   Just as God does not make his promise of pardon to people
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:21.680]   unless they repent, Luke chapter three and verse three,
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:25.640]   as well as Acts 2, 38, you cannot actually say,
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:28.680]   I forgive you, to people unless they admit
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.880]   their sin and repent.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:33.200]   There can be no transaction.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:38.120]   Therefore, the transaction of forgiveness is conditioned
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.940]   in that you can only be fully reconciled
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:43.400]   to those who repent.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.000]   Those who refuse to repent of their sin
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.580]   are not forgiven by God, and of parental sins
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:50.580]   as mentioned earlier.
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:54.080]   And the consequence of a broken relationship
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.020]   with the offended person continues.
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:59.800]   I want you to grab your Bible,
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.600]   and let's go over to Luke chapter 17.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.860]   He's dealing with interpersonal relationships
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:10.700]   among believers in Luke 17, verse three,
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:14.160]   and he says, be on your guard, or be on alert,
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.360]   and by the way, any time you find Jesus saying that
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.960]   in the Bible, you better be on alert.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.360]   All right, he never uses those words carelessly.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.060]   Be on your guard, in other words, this is gonna be hard.
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:28.940]   Luke 17, three.
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:33.520]   If your brother sins, rebuke him,
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:37.420]   and if he repents, forgive him.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.580]   You see what the condition is?
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:41.120]   Brother's repentance, right?
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:45.280]   Now, when he says, if your brother sins, rebuke him,
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.040]   this is not a full indictment.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.660]   There's a different Greek word that could be used
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:51.400]   for a full indictment, of fully indicting somebody
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.920]   for what they've done, without even listening
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.700]   to their side of the story.
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:56.560]   It's not that word.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:00.120]   This word is a tentative rebuke.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.480]   Follow me?
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.840]   This word is a tentative rebuke.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.640]   In other words, if your brother sins,
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.360]   you go to your brother, and it's a sin against you,
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.600]   or at least you perceive it to be a sin against you,
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.800]   you go to your brother, and you tentatively rebuke them.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.200]   In other words, you say something like this.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.440]   I believe that you have sinned against me,
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.280]   but you know what?
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.360]   I'm willing to hear your side of the story.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.920]   That's a tentative rebuke.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.420]   I believe that you have sinned against me,
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:32.640]   but I'm willing to hear your side of the story.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.920]   That's what a tentative rebuke is.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.300]   You're not going to your brother
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.500]   and fully indicting your brother.
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.240]   You're not going to him and saying,
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.760]   I believe you've done this, and this is a terrible thing
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.760]   that you've done against me,
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.760]   and you're just fully indicting that brother.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.520]   No, no, no, you're not doing that.
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.480]   This is a tentative rebuke.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.280]   You're willing to hear their side of the story
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:56.900]   and listen to what they have to say.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:03.520]   So if your brother sins, tentatively rebuke him,
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:08.040]   and if he repents, forgive him.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:08.880]   Wow.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.100]   So Luke chapter 17, verse three,
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:17.520]   says that your part of this responsibility
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.440]   to those who sin against you
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:22.020]   is to confront them tentatively.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:28.480]   Then if they recognize their wrong and repent of it,
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.400]   then you can be reconciled to them and say, I forgive you,
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.480]   which means I'm not going to bring it up to you.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.760]   I'm not going to bring it up to others.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.800]   I'm not going to dwell on it in my own heart and mind
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.620]   and become bitter and resentful against you.
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:44.300]   I'm making this promise of a pardon towards you.
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:50.120]   Now, Matthew chapter 18, verses 15 through 17,
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.240]   there where it talks about church discipline
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:55.540]   makes it clear that you cannot be fully reconciled
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:57.000]   to those who have not repented,
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.600]   because if you could,
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:03.380]   then you could not continue the process of church discipline
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:05.420]   the way the Bible lays it out.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:11.520]   If you forgive everyone without confronting them,
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.320]   then there will be no more repentance.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:19.540]   And if you forgive everyone without confronting them
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:24.160]   and they repenting, there would be no church discipline.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:28.020]   And there would be no church restoration.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:31.580]   There's the condition.
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:37.740]   If the Bible was teaching unconditional forgiveness,
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.040]   then the pastor would have to stand up in the pulpit
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.340]   and say, I know brother so and so is cheating on his wife,
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:45.680]   we all just need to forgive him.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.760]   He's not repenting at all.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.600]   Really?
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:52.400]   We're just supposed to accept that, brother?
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:57.600]   That sounds loving from a worldly point of view,
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.760]   but it's not loving according to Christ's point of view,
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.600]   because Christ's love confronts
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:06.640]   and deals with sin graciously.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:12.860]   Christ's love confronts and deals with sin graciously.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:16.180]   That's the long-term welfare of that brother
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:18.140]   to confront that particular sin,
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:20.580]   to not allow that brother to continue
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:23.180]   in that particular sin unabated.
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:26.060]   Hence, in church discipline,
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:28.940]   that brother is now put out of the church,
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:34.700]   treated like an unbeliever, until he repents.
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:38.200]   And by the way, that happens in 1 Corinthians, right?
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.580]   The brother who's sleeping with his stepmother.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.400]   1 Corinthians 5.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:48.620]   The apostle Paul talks about the fact
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.780]   that you need to put him out of the church.
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:55.700]   And when you get to 2 Corinthians 2,
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.980]   that brother repents and comes back.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:59.100]   And Paul basically says,
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.820]   when you take a look at the Greek language there,
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:03.660]   he says, "Receive that brother back with rejoicing."
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:05.700]   In other words, throw a party for him.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.160]   He's repented of his sin.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.500]   The church needs to throw a party
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.500]   and welcome him back into the membership
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:11.680]   because he's repented.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:16.260]   None of that would happen
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:18.540]   with the concept of unconditional forgiveness.
[01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:19.780]   None of that would occur.
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:24.940]   So Matthew 18, verses 15 through 17,
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:28.380]   makes it very clear that we've got to be able
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.940]   to lovingly, graciously confront sin
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:33.080]   because that's what love does.
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:38.660]   When Christ loves us, he confronts our sin, right?
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.340]   He does.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:42.660]   When he loves us, he confronts our sin
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:46.940]   because that's what's best for our long-term welfare.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:52.780]   Say, okay, I understand what you're saying,
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:53.980]   but I've got a lot of questions.
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:56.940]   Well, let me see if I can cover some of these questions.
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:00.940]   For example, there are other issues
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:04.040]   that are related to this that are very confusing.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:07.220]   One of those issues is the issue
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:12.220]   of confronting a sin versus covering a sin.
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.220]   Have you ever heard somebody say that?
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.300]   Well, you know what?
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.020]   I've just covered that in love.
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.980]   Now, what does that mean?
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:23.580]   When somebody says, "I've just covered that sin in love,"
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:26.340]   that basically means that I've ignored it,
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:28.700]   I've act like it really didn't happen,
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:34.060]   I'm just kind of trying to practice love.
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.580]   Remember how I said this is more like a worldly love
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:37.820]   than it is a godly love?
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:41.100]   I'm just covering that in love.
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:42.340]   That's 1 Peter 4:8.
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.660]   Go over to 1 Peter 4:8.
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:50.080]   Notice what Peter says here in 1 Peter 4:8.
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:55.300]   He says, "Above all,
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.980]   "keep fervent in your love for one another
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.180]   "because love covers a multitude of sin."
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:01.980]   You say, "There it is, there it is.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:03.860]   "Love covers a multitude of sin."
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:08.820]   Well, the question now comes is,
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:12.300]   what is the theological understanding
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.400]   of covering in the Bible?
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:17.580]   What is the theological understanding
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:18.700]   of covering in the Bible?
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:20.260]   Now, I said in our very first session
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:21.900]   we'd go back to this passage,
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:22.820]   so we're gonna go back there.
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:24.780]   Let's go back to Psalm 32.
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:28.280]   Psalm 32.
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.860]   This is what we call Hebrew parallelism.
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:36.660]   And David is talking about his own sin.
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:39.540]   And look at verse one of Psalm 32
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:43.180]   where David says, "How blessed is he
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:46.300]   "whose transgression is forgiven,
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:48.380]   "whose sin is covered."
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:50.380]   In Hebrew parallelism,
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:53.640]   forgiving is equated with covering.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:59.000]   Covering a sin doesn't mean you look the other way.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.360]   Covering a sin does not mean you ignore it.
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:08.680]   Covering a sin means you practice biblical forgiveness.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:09.840]   That's what God does.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.120]   Excuse me.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.400]   He covers all of our sins.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.200]   He covers all of our sins.
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.360]   David even says that.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.720]   What I uncover before God in verse five,
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.560]   God covers with forgiveness.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.100]   That's what he does.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:31.480]   Go over to Psalm 85 in verse two.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.680]   We're building a biblical theology
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.600]   of what does covering mean.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:39.600]   85 in verse two.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:43.000]   It's one of the Psalms of Korah that says,
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.940]   "You forgave the iniquity of your people."
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:48.080]   And here in parallelism,
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.920]   "You covered all their sins."
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.920]   Covering is directly related to the practice of forgiveness.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:00.320]   Not ignoring it, not acting like it never happened.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.880]   It means you're practicing biblical forgiveness.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.640]   So to cover a sin in love
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.780]   doesn't mean you look the other direction.
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:12.040]   To cover a sin in love means
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.120]   that you practice biblical forgiveness.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.960]   That's what it means.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:22.620]   That's a false use of the covering principle.
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:25.980]   What about this?
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:29.560]   What about apologizing versus asking for forgiveness?
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:33.220]   Several years ago when I was a pastor in Ohio,
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:36.240]   I did a whole series of sermons on forgiveness.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.480]   I started off the series by saying,
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.200]   "I'm trying to teach my kids never to apologize."
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:43.360]   And I thought one of our elders
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.960]   was gonna fall out of his chair.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.080]   I did it on purpose.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.800]   But it's really true because nowhere in the Bible
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.200]   does it ever say we're supposed to apologize to one another.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.120]   In fact, the English word for apology
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.120]   comes from the Greek term apologia,
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.200]   which means to throw up a defense.
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.900]   Well, I know my fist struck you in the face,
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:04.120]   but I tripped over a rock, the sun was in my eyes,
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.920]   and I had a stomachache at that time.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.240]   That's the reason, no, no.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:10.260]   I'm throwing up a defense for what I did against you.
[01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:12.200]   All right?
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:17.200]   I'm not really confessing a sin.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:23.080]   No one, nowhere in the Bible does it ever say
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.900]   we're supposed to apologize to people.
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:30.240]   In fact, let's say for instance,
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.480]   I sinned against your pastor, Pastor Mark.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:37.100]   And I went to Pastor Mark and I said to him,
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:42.000]   "Pastor Mark, I sinned against you.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.300]   "I apologize.
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.600]   "What would he say to me?"
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.680]   Eh, forget it.
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.480]   No problem.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:56.900]   It really doesn't do anything for our relationship.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.580]   Right?
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:01.080]   Doesn't do anything.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:04.520]   But if I were to go to him and I were to say to him,
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.400]   "Pastor Mark, I've sinned.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.920]   "It's a sin against God, it's a sin against you.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.720]   "I need to ask you to forgive me."
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:14.920]   Now, what have I done?
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.600]   I have thrown the ball into his court.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.820]   He's got the ball now.
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:22.520]   He's gotta decide, all right,
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.660]   do I wanna forgive that scoundrel John Street?
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:27.340]   All right?
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:28.440]   Do I wanna forgive him?
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.280]   Okay, I'm willing to forgive him.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.520]   All right, John, I forgive you.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.140]   So he throws the ball back.
[01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:35.440]   There's been an exchange.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.840]   I admit my sin, I repent of my sin in front of him.
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:42.160]   He now forgives me, which means he's not gonna bring it up
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.280]   to me ever in the future,
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.040]   not gonna talk about to others.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.200]   He's not gonna dwell on it in his own heart and mind,
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.340]   become bitter and resentful towards me.
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:50.640]   That's what that means.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.120]   That exchange and that promise heals
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.720]   and reconciles that relationship.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:01.900]   Apologizing doesn't do that.
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:06.900]   Apologizing just backs the dump truck of feelings up
[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:10.400]   and dumps your bad feelings on other people,
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.300]   but it doesn't heal any relationship.
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:15.460]   It doesn't do that.
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:22.780]   Seeking forgiveness, repenting of sin heals relationships.
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:29.200]   I think one of the reasons why we apologize
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.740]   is to get around really having a relationship
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:33.860]   with that other person.
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:35.340]   It's one of the main reasons.
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:38.660]   I don't wanna have a relationship with them,
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:40.620]   so I'm just gonna apologize.
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:44.420]   Try to end and put a salve of peace
[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:47.640]   on that particular problem and try to move on with my life,
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.340]   but I'm gonna avoid that person as much as possible.
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.460]   When I see them at church, I'm not gonna talk to 'em.
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:54.420]   I'm like, "No, no, that's not reconciliation.
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:56.340]   "There was reconciliation."
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:16:00.900]   What about this?
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:03.700]   You heard people, "What about forgiving God?"
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.980]   Wow!
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:07.560]   Forgiving God.
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:11.760]   I have a Christian psychologist.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:15.020]   I've got a lot of books from Christian psychology
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:18.340]   in my library.
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.620]   One of those particular books,
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:23.540]   the psychologist tells a story about a woman
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:28.540]   who came to him and she was just really, really upset.
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:33.940]   I mean, she was beside herself
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:37.980]   over the fact that she had married a guy
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:41.100]   who was sort of short in stature
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:44.940]   and all of her kids turned out being short in stature.
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:48.980]   Just bothered her to no end.
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:52.020]   She was just upset by this and just bothered her.
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:55.120]   So what's the Christian psychologist say?
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:00.180]   Well, basically he says, "You're never going to be right
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:04.740]   "until you learn to forgive God."
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:08.140]   Really?
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:13.100]   It's our responsibility to forgive God
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:18.780]   as if somehow God has made this terrible mistake?
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:20.780]   God has not made a terrible mistake.
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:24.580]   He's never made a mistake at all in all of eternity
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:26.660]   and you are not His first mistake.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:30.020]   He doesn't make mistakes.
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:36.340]   Notice what Numbers chapter 23 and verse 19 says.
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:38.580]   Numbers 23 and verse 19,
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.660]   God is not a man that he should lie,
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:43.140]   nor the son of man that he should repent.
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:45.420]   Has he said and will he not do it?
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:49.420]   Or has he spoken and will he not make it good?
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:56.420]   That's blasphemy to somehow suggest,
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:59.500]   well, why would a Christian who's a psychologist
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.020]   suggest that we need to forgive God?
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:04.500]   Because it has therapeutic value.
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:07.880]   It makes me feel justified in the position that I've taken.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.320]   That's why I need to forgive God.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.400]   Really, really?
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.640]   You got to go to the point of blasphemy
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.880]   just to make you feel better?
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:21.840]   No, no, no, we don't blaspheme God.
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.560]   Nowhere in the Bible does it ever say,
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.460]   "We need to forgive God."
[01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:30.160]   That's imported into Christianity from secular sources.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:33.440]   And it's only done because it's supposed to make me
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.720]   feel good about myself.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.400]   After all, that's the important thing, isn't it?
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:41.920]   If I feel good about myself, everything's gonna be great.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:44.840]   I know a lot of Christians that need to feel horrible
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.060]   about themselves.
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:49.580]   They need to feel horrible.
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:51.560]   That's where repentance comes from.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:56.000]   It's where change and understanding God's forgiveness
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.080]   comes from.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.220]   Whoa.
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:01.080]   What about forgiving God?
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:01.960]   Or what about this?
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.680]   What about forgiving unbelievers?
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:09.200]   Remember, an unbeliever is dead,
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.880]   disobedient, depraved, doomed.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:16.120]   You can't ultimately forgive an unbeliever
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.600]   because an unbeliever cannot repent.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:22.040]   Can't do that.
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:26.460]   That doesn't mean you shouldn't have forgiveness
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:27.300]   in your heart.
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.780]   You need to be ready to forgive the way God is.
[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:34.780]   So even though they're dead in their trespasses and sin,
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:39.260]   you can use this as an evangelistic opportunity
[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:43.440]   to explain the forgiveness that comes through Jesus Christ.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:48.500]   Point out their sin and love so that the Lord can use it
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:52.380]   to convict their hearts in order to share biblical truth
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:55.540]   with them about their sin that they've committed
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:56.700]   against you.
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:04.540]   They may not be open, so your loving and patient endurance
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:09.820]   with them, however, can make a difference.
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:11.620]   Let me share with you a quick story.
[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:16.020]   Back while I was still pastoring in Ohio,
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:21.300]   there was a young couple that had just recently come
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:23.580]   to our church about a month before,
[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:28.740]   and they were engaged to be married.
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:34.700]   And the woman, her parents started attending church
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:39.900]   along with her brother as well at that same time,
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.560]   and she came to me and she said,
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:44.660]   would you be willing to do premarital counseling
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:45.980]   with myself and a fiance?
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:48.440]   And I said, absolutely, I'd love to do that.
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.500]   Premarital counseling is fun counseling.
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:53.060]   I mean, I have a blast doing it.
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:56.020]   All right, premarital counseling is just amazing.
[01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:57.820]   All right.
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.460]   (audience laughing)
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:00.300]   It's great.
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:05.760]   I'm not sure that counselees think that, but I think that.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:09.980]   So I said, absolutely, I'll be willing to sit down with you.
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:12.820]   And so we set up an appointment, first appointment.
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:14.020]   Since they were brand new to the church,
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:15.340]   I didn't know much about them,
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:18.260]   so standard operating procedure in first appointment
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:20.620]   was to go through the gospel very, very thoroughly,
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:22.800]   give them homework on the gospel, which we did,
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.580]   send them home with the homework.
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:29.380]   Between that first appointment and the second appointment,
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:34.180]   a whole week goes by, and we were supposed to,
[01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:35.500]   we made an appointment on Monday,
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:36.340]   and then the next Monday,
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:37.780]   we were supposed to have our second appointment.
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:42.040]   On Sunday, I had just preached three times
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:45.380]   in our church services that Sunday, got home,
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:47.620]   and my wife and I put the kids in bed,
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:51.260]   and we just kind of crashed into our beds.
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:53.900]   I was there about 10 minutes, and I got a phone call.
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:56.940]   And I pick up the phone,
[01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:59.700]   and it was this young woman's father.
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:06.220]   And he said to me, our daughter and future son-in-law
[01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:09.760]   was in a horrible car accident.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:14.420]   Would you be willing to come to the emergency room
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:15.480]   and meet us there?
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:16.580]   I said, absolutely.
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:19.860]   I jumped out of bed, threw on my clothes,
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:21.240]   called one of the elders of the church,
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.980]   and said, hey, listen, if you wanna join me,
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:24.940]   let's head over there.
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.500]   So he was willing to do that.
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.500]   We showed up at the emergency room,
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.900]   walked in the door of the emergency room.
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:33.940]   A surgeon comes out from behind the drapes there.
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.140]   They're not supposed to do that,
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:36.620]   but he's covered in blood.
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:37.980]   He said, you must be the pastor.
[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:40.420]   Well, on Sunday night, after a whole day,
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:44.860]   I don't feel like a pastor, but I must've looked like one.
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:47.480]   And he said, listen, I wanna tell you,
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:49.640]   I did everything I could to save her,
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.580]   but I could not save her.
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.740]   Cracked open her chest.
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.580]   I massaged her heart physically.
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:57.380]   I could not keep her alive.
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:59.980]   I said, oh my.
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:01.300]   Said, will you tell the family?
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:02.900]   And I said, sure.
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.140]   I didn't know the family.
[01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:07.340]   I thought, I don't know what I'm getting myself into.
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:10.300]   So I walked into the waiting room,
[01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:13.240]   sat down, by that time, grandpa's and grandma's were there.
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:19.500]   I said, God has chosen to take your daughter.
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:22.020]   At this particular time, there's a lot of tears
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:22.860]   that were shed.
[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:27.860]   It was just incredible at that particular point.
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:32.980]   And we couldn't do anything else for her,
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:35.420]   so they had taken her fiance to another hospital,
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:37.460]   another emergency room, so we all packed up
[01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:41.980]   and went over to see her fiance.
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:43.400]   His name was Rusty.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:48.260]   And we just arrived there just in time to catch him.
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:51.100]   They were pushing him into surgery.
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:54.140]   What had happened was there was a guy
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:57.100]   who had been convicted, convicted,
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.300]   10 times for drunk driving.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:01.620]   That some judge had let him out.
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:06.620]   He ran a stop sign, go on 60 miles an hour,
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:10.920]   T-boned their car into a telephone pole.
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:15.460]   And she was on the side of the car
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:17.980]   that was wrapped around the telephone pole.
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:22.220]   Her fiance was still alive, but the impact of that
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:26.180]   had ripped a microscopic hole in his aorta.
[01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:29.500]   So they had to go, he was bleeding to death from the inside.
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:34.020]   So I am running along the gurney
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:36.240]   as they're pushing him into surgery,
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:39.100]   talking with him about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:44.100]   And he prayed and asked Christ to save him.
[01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:45.700]   And I thought to myself, my goodness,
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:48.000]   probably the last time I'll ever see that man.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.860]   He did survive.
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:54.700]   He got out of surgery, the surgery worked.
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:57.400]   Make a long story, I mean, the long story of that,
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:59.260]   later on he ended up moving to Texas,
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:02.100]   met a young woman whose, her fiance,
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:03.620]   had been killed by a drunk driver.
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:04.900]   They got married.
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:06.220]   They're in a church down there.
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:10.100]   They've got five kids serving the Lord together.
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:13.680]   But I was left with a family.
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:18.380]   And for the next several months, I counseled mom and dad.
[01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:21.180]   Turned out that dad in the family was already a believer.
[01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:22.500]   Mom was not.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.580]   Through that circumstance, mom came to Christ.
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:26.380]   The brother was not a believer.
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:29.440]   He was going to a local secular university
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:32.820]   and was doing some really wicked things.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:34.300]   He came to Christ too.
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:38.940]   And by the way, that young man, he's an older man now,
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:40.880]   is an elder in that church now.
[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:43.560]   Got to lead him to Christ.
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:49.920]   But the father was a big guy.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:50.960]   He was a big guy.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.320]   And he confessed to me in counseling
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:58.880]   that he had been planning to jump the sheriff in the court
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.940]   when he went to see this guy who's being prosecuted.
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:03.480]   And he'd probably be able to do it.
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:04.800]   Steal the gun, shoot the guy,
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.600]   kill him before they could stop him.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.120]   I said, "Don't do that.
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:10.320]   "Don't do this.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.520]   "This is not gonna help things at all.
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:16.120]   "It's gonna bring more grief to your surviving son
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:20.020]   "as well as your wife."
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:21.140]   So he didn't do that.
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:24.060]   Fast forward 10 years.
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:27.080]   It's the last month that I'm the pastor there
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.520]   before I moved to California to teach at Masters.
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:33.000]   They call me up and they say,
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.260]   "Pastor, we want to go to the local prison
[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:38.420]   "to see the guy that killed our daughter.
[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:41.440]   "We want you to go with us."
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.440]   (gasps)
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:48.240]   Are you sure you want to do this?
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.600]   Yes, yes, yes, we want to.
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:54.000]   Okay, let's go.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.400]   So I agreed to go with them, went to the prison.
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:00.280]   They had a room there.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:02.000]   This guy came in with his lawyer
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.320]   and they had stationed four of the biggest guards
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:05.320]   you ever saw.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.680]   I mean, they could be the front line
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.500]   to the University of Southern California football team.
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.780]   I mean, they were big guys.
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:17.920]   And this couple shared with him,
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:22.080]   "You know, not long after this happened,
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:25.400]   "we wished you dead.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.820]   "We don't wish that any longer
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:34.200]   "because the Lord Jesus Christ has changed our life."
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:38.920]   And they began to share their testimony with him.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:43.260]   And they said, "We would love to be able to forgive you,
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:45.340]   "but we can't because you can't repent.
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:51.140]   "And besides that, what you've done in killing our daughter
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:55.240]   "is not nearly as important as the fact
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.640]   "that there is this big elephant in the room
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:00.180]   "and that is your rebellion against God."
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:04.680]   That's the real issue.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.580]   Killing our daughter is only a symptom
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:08.060]   of that bigger issue.
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:12.340]   It's only a symptom of the bigger issue.
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:20.680]   And I looked up and every single guard in that room
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:23.300]   had tears in their eyes.
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:27.460]   I don't think those guys had ever seen
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:29.080]   anything like that before.
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:37.060]   When we're talking about forgiving unbelievers,
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:41.420]   the issue is not their sin against us, ultimately.
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:45.780]   The issue is their sin against God
[01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:47.820]   and their rebellion against God.
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:51.340]   That's what really has to be dealt with first.
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:54.640]   It's an eternal issue, not a temporal issue.
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:03.700]   Like Peter exhorted the wives in 1 Peter 3,
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:08.460]   that their job is to win the unbelieving husband over
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:11.980]   without a word by the behavior of their lives.
[01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:15.360]   That's what needs to be done here.
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.240]   You don't win your unbelieving husband over
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:21.260]   by putting repent on the bottom of his beer can.
[01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:23.820]   That's not the way you win him over.
[01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:27.500]   You don't win him over by lecturing him into righteousness.
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:29.780]   You don't win him over that way.
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:32.660]   That just drives him further from the truth.
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:34.520]   How do you win your husband over?
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:37.180]   You do it by the behavior of your life.
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:40.020]   That's how you do that.
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:45.360]   You say, okay, well, what about forgiving dead people?
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:46.660]   What about that?
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:48.500]   You've probably heard, somebody's died
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.600]   and done something against you.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.360]   You're supposed to put a chair in the middle of the room,
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:53.580]   pretend that they're there,
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:55.740]   read them the riot act and all that.
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:58.620]   Boy, you know that's dangerously close necromancy.
[01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:01.580]   That is talking with the dead, and the Bible's very clear.
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:03.940]   We're not supposed to talk with the dead.
[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:07.340]   We don't need to do that.
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:08.160]   Why?
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.180]   Because if we're already practicing
[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:12.040]   attitudinal forgiveness in our heart,
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:16.820]   we're willing to forgive anyone of anything.
[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:19.820]   God knows if that person who had already passed away
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:22.800]   and sinned against you, if they had repented,
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.760]   He knows in your heart
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.320]   that you could automatically forgive them.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:30.760]   You don't put a chair in the middle of the room
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:33.840]   and pretend that they're there and read them the riot act
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:36.920]   and all of a sudden act as if somehow that takes care of it.
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:38.300]   Why do people do that kind of thing?
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.020]   Again, for the therapeutic value.
[01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:44.020]   Or here's a big one.
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:45.900]   What about forgiving ourselves?
[01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:49.120]   I know God can forgive me.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:53.080]   I know you can forgive me, but I just can't forgive myself.
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:56.800]   Do you realize how prideful that statement is?
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:01.160]   You realize how prideful that is?
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:03.320]   As if God has a standard of forgiveness,
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.720]   other people have a standard of forgiveness.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:07.160]   Well, my standard of forgiveness in terms of myself
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.040]   is so much higher.
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:12.560]   It's so much higher.
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.280]   Nowhere in the Bible does it ever say
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.220]   that we need to forgive ourselves.
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:20.680]   What they mean is that they have a hard time
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:22.840]   getting over what they've done.
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:24.640]   You don't forgive yourself.
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:28.540]   You repent and you do what is right.
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:32.180]   We're not supposed to forgive it.
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:34.420]   There's not a hint of that anywhere in the Bible.
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:35.900]   Where's that come from?
[01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:36.860]   Psychology.
[01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:38.100]   It comes from psychology.
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:40.300]   Again, it has a therapeutic value.
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:42.180]   It makes me feel good about myself.
[01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:43.660]   The fact that I need to forgive myself.
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:44.580]   Really?
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:49.660]   As if somehow your standard of righteousness
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:51.180]   is better than God's.
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:54.420]   God can forgive me, but I just can't forgive myself.
[01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:59.420]   How incredibly prideful that arrogant viewpoint on life is.
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:04.740]   Wow.
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:10.220]   What can we say about this?
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:12.460]   Is it possible to be too forgiving?
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:15.060]   Grab your Bible just for a moment.
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:18.700]   Let's go over to Revelation chapter two.
[01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:22.760]   Revelation chapter two in verse 20.
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:25.760]   (silence)
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:31.680]   Here the Lord is speaking to the church there at Thyatira.
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:34.480]   And it says in verse 20,
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:35.880]   "But I have this against you,
[01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:37.680]   "that you tolerate the woman Jezebel
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.660]   "who calls herself a prophetess,
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:42.500]   "and she teaches and leads my bond servants astray
[01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:44.780]   "so that they commit acts of immorality
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:47.520]   "and eat things offered to idols."
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:54.280]   Now this Jezebel is probably a moniker,
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:55.720]   probably a nickname,
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.480]   'cause this is the Old Testament.
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:00.020]   This wicked woman in the Old Testament.
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:02.080]   This is not her actual name,
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:03.560]   but she assumed this name.
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:05.640]   This is what God, in a sense,
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:08.640]   nicknamed this woman there in the church at Thyatira
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:09.620]   was Jezebel.
[01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:13.360]   But if you look in verse 20 at the word tolerate,
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.760]   you see that word tolerate?
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:18.120]   That's exactly the same Greek word
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:19.880]   as we talked about forgiveness.
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:21.480]   It's the word ephiamy.
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:26.080]   In this particular case,
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:31.080]   Christians actually can practice too much forgiveness
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:34.660]   in overlooking sin.
[01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:42.920]   You tolerate, you forgive too much
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:46.040]   people who are practicing open sin.
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.520]   That's not the way that the church of Jesus Christ
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:51.680]   should be.
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:57.520]   We become too tolerant of sin.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:04.400]   I understand the concept of tolerance,
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:08.220]   but when we become tolerant of sin,
[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:11.680]   that's bad stuff.
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:15.440]   Tolerant of sin.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:18.600]   So how should we forgive?
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:21.440]   How should we forgive?
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:22.860]   Let me close off with this.
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:26.480]   The Bible says we need to forgive immediately.
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:30.280]   If your brother sins,
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:33.560]   and if he repents,
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.640]   forgive him.
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:40.880]   But then go back to Luke 17 again
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:43.800]   as we close this off.
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:44.960]   Luke 17.
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:50.960]   And we're interested in verse four,
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:53.940]   where it says,
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:56.780]   "And if he sins against you seven times in a day,
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:59.920]   "and returns to you seven times,
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.420]   "saying, 'I repent, forgiven.'"
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:03.260]   Listen to this.
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:06.020]   That's seven times in one day.
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:13.680]   Let's say, for instance,
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:16.040]   you're working next to a guy who has a problem with anger.
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.240]   He's a brand new Christian,
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:19.240]   and he's working,
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:20.880]   and he gets really frustrated at what he's doing.
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.680]   He turns around and boom,
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:25.280]   pops you right in the kisser.
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:27.440]   All right?
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.360]   You go, "Oh!"
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:31.440]   And he said, "Oh, listen, that's wrong of me.
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:33.480]   "I really have sinned against you.
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:34.480]   "It's a sin against God.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.920]   "Will you forgive me?"
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.960]   Sure.
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:41.240]   You're rubbing your mouth like this.
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.240]   I'm willing to forgive you.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:45.680]   An hour later, he's frustrated again,
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:49.000]   turns around, boom, in the kisser one more time.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.400]   You go, "Whoa!
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.120]   "Oh, listen, I just, you know,
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:54.680]   "this thing got really bad.
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.520]   "It's sin.
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:59.180]   "Will you forgive me?"
[01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:04.080]   You're rubbing this.
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:08.040]   You're saying, "Yeah, okay, I'm willing to forgive you."
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:11.320]   Couple hours later, boom!
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:13.120]   That was the third time.
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:16.040]   He goes, "Oh, listen, I'm working on this.
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:18.560]   "You need to work faster," you say.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:22.600]   This is getting really puffy now.
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:25.120]   "Will you forgive me?"
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.400]   Yes, I forgive you.
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:30.880]   Seven times?
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:33.240]   One day.
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:37.600]   All right, now you're starting to feel it, right?
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.160]   Now you're starting to feel it.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:46.360]   Your reaction to that is exactly that of the apostles,
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:48.200]   'cause look at verse five.
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.160]   You can almost see 'em.
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:53.040]   It says, "The apostles said to the Lord,
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.760]   "O Lord, increase our faith."
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:58.800]   You can almost see them throw their hands up in the air.
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.320]   Are you kidding me?
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:01.800]   Seven times in one day,
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:04.980]   there's no time to look for the fruit of repentance.
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:10.560]   You have to forgive them based upon their word.
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:15.480]   No time to inspect fruit.
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:17.760]   Seven times, one day.
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:21.080]   Wow.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:28.160]   Basically, Jesus tells a story about the slave,
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:32.040]   and he concludes in verse 10 by saying,
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:36.880]   "If we are unworthy slaves,
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.620]   "then we're willing to do anything
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:40.600]   "that our master wants us to do."
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:44.080]   That's the standpoint that we have to approach
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.520]   all forgiveness from the standpoint of,
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:49.280]   I am an unworthy slave.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.180]   So we need to forgive immediately.
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:55.660]   We need to forgive repeatedly.
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:38:01.360]   And we need to forgive,
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:04.480]   like the man who committed immorality
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:06.780]   with a stepmother in 1 Corinthians,
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:09.720]   we need to forgive lavishly.
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:15.360]   He says, "Rather, forgive and comfort,
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:18.760]   "lest somehow such a one be overwhelmed
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:21.040]   "by excessive sorrow."
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:24.220]   Why should we forgive?
[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:31.080]   Because you are more like Christ when you do.
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:36.420]   You are more like Christ.
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:38.120]   When you do.
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:40.020]   When you forgive.
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:45.600]   It has been a wonderful pleasure
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:48.120]   for me to be with you this weekend.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.620]   I have gained, and my wife has too,
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:52.840]   many new friends.
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:54.200]   I look forward to seeing you
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:56.160]   or talking with you in the future.
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:00.440]   I hope that what we've studied has been helpful
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:04.720]   in bringing about genuine idea in your heart
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:08.220]   about what true, vivid, reconciliation is.
[01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:11.560]   Let's bow our hearts in prayer, shall we?
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.660]   Gracious Lord, you are so good.
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:20.060]   You're so gracious.
[01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:22.260]   You're so loving towards us.
[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:26.900]   That when we sin against you,
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:31.640]   you actively do not remember our sins against us.
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:33.540]   You pardon us of our sin
[01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:36.100]   because of what Jesus Christ has done
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:41.100]   in his perpetuary death and atoning work on the cross.
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:47.960]   May we, as unworthy, undeserving, forgiven sinners,
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:54.960]   be quick to forgive others who seek our forgiveness.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:02.880]   Only then can we have truly reconciled relationships.
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:08.600]   And so, Father, I pray for Berean as a church
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:12.640]   that represents the testimony and the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:15.280]   I pray for the pastoral staff,
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:18.760]   for all that are involved in the various ministries.
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:21.600]   I pray for all that attend this church,
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.120]   that as they are faithful to you
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:27.960]   and practice biblical reconciliation,
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:32.960]   that your hand will rest richly upon them
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.200]   and will really bless them.
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:39.860]   This we pray in Christ's name, amen.
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:52.280]   - Dr. Street, thank you so much
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:55.800]   for dedicating your time to speak to our church.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:58.720]   Dr. Street is a very busy man.
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:02.340]   So we were so blessed that he was able to say yes.
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:04.760]   And even though, originally I think it was last year, right?
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:07.680]   And then we had to postpone it, is that, yeah.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:11.920]   And so he's a man who wears many different hats, right?
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:13.800]   He travels everywhere.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:15.840]   He's an author, he's a professor,
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:20.140]   he leads the ACBC counseling,
[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:24.840]   and he's also an elder at Grace Community Church.
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:29.840]   And so he's a husband, he's a grandfather, father.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:32.840]   And so the fact that we were able to have him
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:34.040]   for the weekend, I mean,
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:36.160]   it was a tremendous blessing for our church.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:39.480]   And so let's thank Dr. Street and Mr. Street who came.
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:40.800]   (audience applauding)
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:44.120]   So thank you, thank you so much.
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:52.160]   Some of you are aware, and some of you may not be aware,
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:55.460]   that a few years ago,
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:58.200]   we made a conscious decision in our leadership
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.840]   that we want to be more deliberate
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:03.400]   in pushing our church toward biblical counseling.
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:06.120]   And so some people, when you think of biblical counseling,
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.220]   you think of, you know, do you have a problem,
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:10.400]   are you depressed, or something happened in your life,
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:12.600]   and I need specific counseling.
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:16.360]   And watching my wife Esther going through the program,
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:21.200]   and I had a completely paradigm shift in the past few years,
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:23.000]   that biblical counseling really is something
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.760]   that everybody needs to learn how to do, be trained,
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:28.360]   because basically it's discipling other people
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:29.720]   with God's word.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:30.560]   You know, when the Bible says
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:31.960]   not to be conformed to this world,
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:34.680]   but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:37.060]   and that's basically a summary of biblical counseling,
[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:40.860]   using the word of God specifically for everyone, right?
[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:42.360]   There isn't a single one of us
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:45.360]   that is not messed up in some way, right?
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.560]   Some of us are more obvious,
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:50.080]   and some of us are more willing to admit it,
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.320]   but every single one of us, you know,
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:55.200]   there are negative effects that has caused us
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:58.760]   to live in such a way that is contrary to the word of God.
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:02.020]   And so biblical counseling basically is learning the skill
[01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:04.400]   to specifically apply the word of God
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:06.580]   in a very specific manner.
[01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:08.800]   And so again, I think it was really appropriate
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:12.960]   that Dr. Street came, and hopefully we were motivated,
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.000]   and even it's just the way in his teaching,
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.240]   it's not just, you know, like just general,
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.240]   we need to forgive, and we need to do this,
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:22.760]   and the way he was able to go through the specifics
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:25.040]   of dealing with the heart, right?
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:27.920]   What it means to be reconciled, what it means to forgive,
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:29.880]   and just going through the verses,
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:31.820]   and to be able to apply that,
[01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:33.840]   sitting in front of somebody one-to-one,
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:37.280]   and that's really, in the end, what discipleship is, right?
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:39.120]   Is how to apply the word of God
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:40.440]   specifically in people's lives.
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:43.080]   And so one of the things that he mentioned,
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:46.040]   that there's masters, college, university,
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:50.280]   they offer a two-year program to train people,
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:52.680]   and I know that some of us who are able to do that,
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:55.200]   we encourage you to consider that,
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:58.440]   but also along with that, some of our church people
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:02.160]   are already in the process of getting
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:05.400]   the biblical counseling training through other sources.
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:07.040]   I think, what do they call that?
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:10.240]   ACBC, but what do you call that?
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:11.860]   Certification, okay?
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:15.280]   So that's something that you can do
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:17.720]   without committing two years, if you can't do that,
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:19.000]   you can, there are programs.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.760]   We're hoping that eventually, that Pastor Mark
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.840]   will be able to lead our church
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:25.240]   in that direction more specifically,
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:27.560]   and that's why we asked him to go get his doctorate
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:31.520]   in that field, so that we can apply that in our church, okay?
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:32.920]   So, but even before then,
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:36.100]   and that's probably gonna happen sooner than later,
[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:39.720]   there are, like they have ACBC conferences that come up
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:41.720]   that we ask people to go and attend,
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:44.380]   and that'll kind of get you started in that process.
[01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:46.640]   And so, this is something that we've been wrestling
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.460]   as a church, especially as our church is getting bigger,
[01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:53.840]   how do we disciple our church as it continues to grow?
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:56.660]   Right, and this is something that, again,
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:59.480]   in the past few years, that I've been really convicted
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:01.440]   that this is the path that we need to go,
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:03.640]   and it's not just about certain people
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:05.240]   that needs to sit down with a counselor,
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:07.080]   the whole church needs to learn
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:08.720]   how to apply this in our lives,
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:11.040]   and how to help other people apply this in this life.
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:14.540]   And so, again, we'll give you more specific information
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:19.420]   as time goes, but hopefully all of you had enough of it
[01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:21.700]   where you realize this is not just something
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:24.700]   for professionals, you need to go get a doctor to do this,
[01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:27.020]   this is something that every Christian should learn
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:29.100]   how to apply this in our life, okay?
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:34.140]   Along with that, as we wrap up our retreat,
[01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:36.540]   many of the things that he said,
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:38.900]   for application encouragement,
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:41.040]   as you are headed down after lunch,
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:46.140]   we want, get in the habit of becoming active listeners,
[01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:48.620]   meaning that you listen, and then if you just
[01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:51.100]   kind of turn it off, and then you just go into the next
[01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:54.140]   thing that's on your schedule, it's easy to forget.
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:57.100]   And then if you ask next week, what did you learn,
[01:45:57.100 --> 01:45:58.980]   you won't remember, right?
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:01.000]   And so get in the habit between husband and wife,
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.860]   asking each other, what did you learn, right?
[01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:04.700]   What did you learn?
[01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:06.940]   While you're driving down, you got two to six hours,
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:08.500]   depending on the traffic, right?
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:12.980]   Ask each other, right, what did you learn specifically,
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:15.420]   on the first message, second, third message?
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:16.900]   And if you have children in the car,
[01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:20.540]   and they learn from Sunday school, ask your kids,
[01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:22.980]   what was taught today, what did you learn?
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:26.540]   And then ask, how are you going to specifically apply that?
[01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:29.980]   Where in your heart do you see that you need to really dig
[01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:34.840]   and to, you know, to reveal, and to repent, and to forgive,
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:36.480]   where does this need to be applied?
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:40.260]   And hopefully you guys can have that meaningful conversation
[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:41.100]   while you're going there.
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:43.340]   It doesn't have to be the whole ride,
[01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:45.900]   but at least get in the habit of, not just at this retreat,
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.700]   but every Sunday, every Bible study,
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:50.900]   get in the habit of asking each other, what did you learn?
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:52.460]   What are you applying?
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:54.420]   And so that we're not just listening,
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:56.500]   that we're actively trying to apply everything
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:57.340]   that we're learning.
[01:46:57.340 --> 01:47:00.460]   So again, I encourage you to do that.
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:02.780]   And then as I said, at the beginning of the retreat,
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:06.060]   one of the benefits of us coming together
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:08.620]   is that we're able to break some ice, right?
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:10.660]   Some of you guys are brand new.
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:13.220]   I met some of you who've never even been to Berean.
[01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:15.820]   The retreat's the first time that you've been around Bereans,
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:16.780]   right?
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:18.620]   And then obviously, some of you have been here
[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:20.100]   for many, many years.
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:23.580]   Hopefully some of the ice has been broken.
[01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:29.260]   And then from here on, it could be very awkward at church,
[01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:30.880]   because you're going to see their face.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:33.980]   I remember meeting you, but I remember your name.
[01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:36.540]   And then you walk the other way, because you
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:38.100]   don't want to be embarrassed.
[01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:41.660]   So as I told you, I want to encourage you,
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:46.940]   in the name of Jesus Christ, be awkward, right?
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:50.260]   If you remember their face, yeah, I know I talked to you.
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:51.940]   I had lunch, breakfast, dinner.
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:52.980]   You were my small group.
[01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:56.180]   I don't remember you, right?
[01:47:56.180 --> 01:47:58.980]   It's better to be awkward in the beginning
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:02.060]   and build friendship and relationship going forward
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:04.220]   than to continue to avoid that person
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:06.100]   and then get more awkward as time goes.
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:08.300]   And then you've got a whole bunch of people at church
[01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:11.100]   you've got to stay away from, right?
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:12.500]   So I want to encourage you.
[01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:15.900]   So if you see them at church, see them down the street,
[01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:19.500]   even if you didn't, get in the habit of asking, hey,
[01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:20.540]   I don't remember you.
[01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:21.840]   I don't know if we've ever met.
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:24.060]   And they say, oh, yeah, we did.
[01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:24.980]   Sorry.
[01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:27.420]   And then even if you have to do it for the next four or five
[01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:28.100]   times, right?
[01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:33.700]   As our church grows, we need to be thick-faced in order
[01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:37.460]   to build relationships that's going to last, OK?
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:38.420]   No joke.
[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:42.340]   There's many, many years of avoiding shame
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:44.580]   that I've come to the conclusion that I
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:47.220]   have to do this in order to build
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:49.420]   meaningful relationship, OK?
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:51.660]   So hopefully you can do that even today,
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:53.260]   even during lunchtime.
[01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:56.460]   And then again, as we wrap up, I want to specifically thank
[01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:59.020]   our brother Jason, who has been--
[01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:01.420]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:08.740]   And I know there are many people who serve.
[01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:11.260]   But obviously, I cannot mention all of you.
[01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:13.580]   There's everybody in the background, all the teachers
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:15.580]   who are taking care of our children.
[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:18.260]   So everybody, we want to give thanks
[01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:19.660]   to everybody who served.
[01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:23.220]   But again, Jason was kind of spearheading all of this.
[01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:28.540]   And this is-- it's hard running a 100-people retreat.
[01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:30.340]   That is perfect.
[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:31.540]   Yes.
[01:49:31.540 --> 01:49:32.540]   OK.
[01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:34.940]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:38.500]   Yeah, so there's a lot going on in his life.
[01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:45.660]   And again, we want to thank Jason for just sacrificing.
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:48.820]   And then hopefully when he goes home, he can take a fat nap
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:49.540]   as a reward.
[01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:52.500]   And it happens to be his 51st birthday today.
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:54.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:59.820]   It's actually 41, but I'm assuming he aged 10 years
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:01.540]   while he was here.
[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:02.260]   OK.
[01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:04.660]   So again, thank all of you for coming.
[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:07.860]   And as our church continues to grow, as we mentioned,
[01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:09.860]   part of the reason why we practice membership
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:12.380]   in our church, we're trying to be intentional with everything
[01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:13.260]   that we're doing.
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:15.460]   And as our church grows, it becomes harder and harder
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:18.220]   to be intentional just from the leadership.
[01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:20.060]   So our intentionality has to come
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:22.260]   from every member at the church, that things
[01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:25.980]   that you're learning has to be applied on the daily lives.
[01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:28.860]   And so again, I want to encourage and challenge you.
[01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:31.780]   Everything that you've heard, how can I personally
[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:33.260]   apply that instead of just waiting,
[01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:35.460]   well, what is the leadership going to do?
[01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:36.940]   How can I personally apply that?
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:40.060]   Because ultimately, when you live your Christian life
[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:44.180]   in isolation, and you do good, and you go before God,
[01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:46.180]   people will thank you.
[01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:48.300]   If you're generous, they say, oh, you're a generous person.
[01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:50.380]   If you're gracious, you're a gracious person.
[01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:53.340]   But when that happens in the context of a community
[01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:55.820]   and with other people sharing and building the church
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:58.300]   together, God gets the glory.
[01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:01.100]   Because what unifies us, what causes us together
[01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:04.340]   to be gracious, is just not because one person is gracious.
[01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:06.900]   It's because of what Christ has done for us.
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:09.740]   And so that's why building a church, a deliberate church
[01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:12.420]   that honors and glorifies God, is our goal.
[01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:16.060]   Whether we are 60, 600, or 6,000,
[01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:19.140]   however, whatever the growth of the church
[01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:21.300]   is, that from this point on, let's
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:23.180]   say we continue to add more people,
[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:26.300]   there's no way this is going to continue
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:28.180]   with just the leadership.
[01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:29.580]   We need every member in the church
[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:31.540]   to be bought into what we're trying to do.
[01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:33.940]   And again, this is not unique to Beroean Community Church.
[01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:37.380]   This is what the scripture tells us to do.
[01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:39.700]   So again, we want to thank all of you who are here.
[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:42.500]   So just one more announcement.
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:44.620]   After this, there's going to be a small group time.
[01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:46.460]   And then around 12 o'clock--
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:48.140]   oh, you have the announcement?
[01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:50.860]   OK, we'll let Jason give the announcement.
[01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:51.360]   OK.
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:59.260]   All right, we have a few key announcements right now.
[01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:01.620]   Because the session went a little longer
[01:52:01.620 --> 01:52:03.620]   than anticipated, we're actually going
[01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:05.540]   to have you guys, all the parents,
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:08.140]   go over and pick up the kids after this
[01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:11.220]   and head directly to the photo, for the all-church photo.
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:13.340]   For the Sprouts and Nursery, go pick up your kids
[01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:16.620]   and head over to the lawn area with the fountain.
[01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:23.900]   Checkout time is at 1 PM.
[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:25.820]   You guys hear me?
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:29.180]   Checkout time is at 1 PM.
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:31.460]   So after the photo session, for those of you
[01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:33.980]   who haven't checked out already, clear out your rooms
[01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:35.500]   right after the photo session.
[01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:38.620]   Go to your rooms and pack up.
[01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:41.460]   If you arrived earlier, a day early,
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:45.900]   you guys need to go to the hotel and check out that way.
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:47.980]   For the rest of you who didn't arrive a day early,
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:49.900]   you guys don't need to do anything.
[01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:51.940]   Just clear out your rooms and you're good to go.
[01:52:51.940 --> 01:53:01.700]   And after lunch, please make sure you guys
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:04.140]   take your lanyards and ID holders.
[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:06.580]   There's two boxes at the registration table.
[01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:07.620]   Put them in there.
[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:10.260]   Please remove the inserts in the ID holders
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:11.380]   before you do that.
[01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:14.580]   And don't mix them up.
[01:53:14.580 --> 01:53:15.900]   It's going to be very clear.
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:19.540]   One's the ID holders and the other is the lanyards.
[01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:23.060]   And lastly, we do have the winners for the podcast
[01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:25.100]   for those of you that did listen.
[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:27.060]   It's going to be posted on the Facebook page.
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:29.500]   Just spare you guys some time right now.
[01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:32.140]   We'll email you guys your gift card prizes.
[01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:32.860]   I think that's it.
[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:33.360]   Thank you.
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:35.060]   And Pastor Peter will close us in prayer.
[01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:41.260]   Sorry.
[01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:42.780]   I probably didn't clarify this part.
[01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:46.820]   Small group time, do that during your lunch time.
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:48.820]   Do the small group time during your lunch time.
[01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:51.060]   Thank you.
[01:53:51.060 --> 01:53:51.980]   All right.
[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:54.420]   OK, so right after this, we're going straight out there.
[01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:56.100]   Those of you who need to grab your kids,
[01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:58.580]   go grab your kids and try to come out as soon as you can.
[01:53:58.580 --> 01:54:00.220]   And then right after that, I think
[01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:02.620]   we'll probably go pack up and stuff and go to lunch.
[01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:04.460]   And then at lunchtime, do your small group.
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:06.620]   And then your small group will be the conclusion
[01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:08.460]   of the retreat.
[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:11.460]   And then I'll stand up for the closing praise.
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:14.940]   [MUSIC - "YOUR GRACE"]
[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:42.700]   Your grace that leads the sinner home from death to life
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:52.020]   forever and sings the song of righteousness
[01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:55.420]   by blood and not by memory.
[01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:58.900]   [MUSIC - "YOUR GRACE"]
[01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:19.620]   Your grace that reaches far and wide to every tribe and nation
[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:28.820]   has called my heart to enter in the joy of your salvation.
[01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:37.420]   By grace I am redeemed.
[01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:42.660]   By grace I am restored.
[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:51.620]   And now I freely walk into the arms of Christ my Lord.

[01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:12.540]   Your grace that I cannot explain, not by my earthly
[01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:22.180]   wisdom, the prince of life without a stain
[01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:25.540]   was traded for this sin.
[01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:33.540]   By grace I am redeemed.
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:38.540]   By grace I am restored.
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:47.540]   And now I freely walk into the arms of Christ my Lord.

[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:02.500]   Let praise rise up and overflow.
[01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:08.500]   My song resound forever.
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:22.460]   For grace will see me welcomed home to walk beside my Savior.
[01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:24.900]   Let's learn by grace.
[01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:29.860]   By grace I am redeemed.
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:34.860]   By grace I am restored.
[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:42.820]   And now I freely walk into the arms of Christ my Lord.
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:45.300]   One more time, by grace.
[01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:50.660]   By grace I am redeemed.
[01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:56.140]   By grace I am restored.
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:58:06.140]   And now I freely walk into the arms of Christ my Lord.
[01:58:06.140 --> 01:58:14.120]   That's great.
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:18.100]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much, Lord God,
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:22.020]   for the privilege that we've had this weekend.
[01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:24.500]   We know, Father, there are many brothers and sisters
[01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:28.980]   around the world who are gathering together each week,
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:33.460]   Lord God, not knowing the suffering and the persecution
[01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:35.420]   that they're under.
[01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:38.420]   Help us, Lord, as we continue to support and fellowship
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:40.420]   with the brothers around the world,
[01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:42.420]   that we would not take for granted everything
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:43.420]   that you've given us.
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:45.420]   I pray that all the teaching that you've
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:47.420]   given this weekend, that it would truly
[01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:49.420]   bear fruit in our hearts, Lord God,
[01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:51.420]   that we would not leave this retreat, Lord,
[01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:56.420]   with just more knowledge, but help us to truly practice
[01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:58.420]   biblical reconciliation.
[01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:04.420]   What that means, Lord God, to be mindful, Lord, of our hearts,
[01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:09.420]   to be able to expose, to repent, to be reconciled, to forgive,
[01:59:09.420 --> 01:59:15.420]   and that as our church practices the love that Christ showed us,
[01:59:15.420 --> 01:59:19.420]   that the world will know, Father God, who we are.
[01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:21.420]   So I pray that you would continue to build a church that
[01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:25.420]   honors you, glorifies you, and to be a brighter and brighter
[01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:27.420]   light, Lord God, in this dark world,
[01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:30.420]   that we may be able to share with more and more people,
[01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:34.420]   Lord God, the hope that is in Christ, in Christ alone.
[01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:38.420]   We thank you, Father God, for Dr. Street and Mrs. Street,
[01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:41.420]   Lord God, who sacrificed to be with us this weekend.
[01:59:41.420 --> 01:59:43.420]   I pray that you would give tremendous blessing
[01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:46.420]   over their families, their children, their grandchildren,
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:49.420]   for their ministry, that you would use them for many years
[01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:51.420]   to come, Lord God, to spread the good news of the gospel
[01:59:51.420 --> 01:59:53.420]   of Jesus Christ.
[01:59:53.420 --> 01:59:55.420]   Give them the physical strength that they need,
[01:59:55.420 --> 01:59:58.420]   the spiritual vitality, relationship, Lord God,
[01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:01.420]   and unity, Lord, in all that they do,
[02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:04.420]   that many more people would come to know who you are,
[02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:07.420]   and that you would bless them, that they would be a blessing
[02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:09.420]   to many others as well.
[02:00:09.420 --> 02:00:11.420]   So we pray for guidance.
[02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:13.420]   Father God, as we conclude your life,
[02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:15.420]   wisdom, that we would seek you, Lord,
[02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:17.420]   and that we would seek true wisdom, Lord God,
[02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:20.420]   not of this world, but according to your kingdom.
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:24.420]   And so we ask, Lord God, as we wrap up this retreat,
[02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:28.420]   that you would help us to apply all that you've given
[02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:30.420]   for the sake of the name of Jesus Christ.
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:32.420]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:33.420]   Amen.

[02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:36.420]   God sent his son.
[02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:41.420]   They called him Jesus.
[02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:51.420]   He came to love, heal, and forgive.
[02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:56.420]   He lived and died.
[02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:13.420]   To buy my pardon, an empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.
[02:01:13.420 --> 02:01:24.420]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[02:01:27.420 --> 02:01:35.420]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[02:01:35.420 --> 02:01:46.420]   Because I know he holds the future.
[02:01:49.420 --> 02:01:59.420]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
