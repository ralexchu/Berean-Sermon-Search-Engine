[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.540]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.540]   As we continue to celebrate the resurrection of Christ,
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.540]   as you guys know, we had a very busy week this week.
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.540]   But along with that, we initially intended
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.540]   to celebrate our 25th, church's 25th anniversary today.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.540]   And that's why we have all the food outside.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.540]   So it is Resurrection Sunday, and along with that,
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.540]   it is our 25th church anniversary.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.540]   So we had various things planned,
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.540]   but we're gonna postpone it because we don't want
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.540]   our birthday to overshadow the Resurrection Sunday.
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.540]   And so the only reason, again, why we are here celebrating
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.540]   and having our 25th anniversary
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.540]   is because of what Christ has done.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:29.540]   So we wanna make sure that we give proper recognition
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.540]   to that first.
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.540]   So again, after the service, we will have food ready outside.
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.540]   So you can grab it and the tables and chairs are set up
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.540]   just all throughout the church parking lot and side area.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.540]   So you guys can stick around and make sure you enjoy that.
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.540]   Again, but just a brief mention,
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.540]   our church was inaugurated April 12th, 1997.
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.540]   It was the day that the church was inaugurated.
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.540]   And actually, that day, I was supposed to come
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.540]   and celebrate together, but we ended up having
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.540]   our first child, Jeremy, on the same day.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.540]   And so I wasn't able to come.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.540]   So every year we celebrate the church's birthday,
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:08.540]   it is also my son's birthday.
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.540]   So April 12th, 1997.
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.540]   Our church really was not a typical church plant
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.540]   because typically when you plant the church,
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.540]   you're prepared, you have finance ready,
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.540]   you have core group and vision statement, doctrinal statement.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.540]   That's not the way our church got planted.
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.540]   Our church got planted basically out of necessity.
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.540]   We were kind of forced to just survive.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.540]   And at that time, we had basically children at the church.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.540]   We had 16-year-olds, 17-year-olds, 18-year-olds,
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.540]   and a few college students spread out.
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.540]   And so the only reason why we didn't fold
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.540]   is because we were concerned that if we folded,
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.540]   that these children were not going to be able
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.540]   to continue in their faith.
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.540]   And out of concern for them, we just kept meeting,
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.540]   not thinking that this is a church,
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.540]   not thinking that we're going to do something with this
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.540]   just to keep them going.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.540]   And by the grace of God, 25 years later, we're here.
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.540]   And so those kids who were 16, 18, 19 at that time,
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.540]   they're in their 40s now.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.540]   And so we're able to celebrate that.
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.540]   And again, all of that is because of the grace of God
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.540]   and because of what we're celebrating today.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.540]   And so again, please stick around and enjoy the lunch with us
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.540]   and just a couple of announcements before we get going.
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.540]   Next week, we have a members meeting at 2.30.
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.540]   And so there is going to be a service fair,
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.540]   meaning that there's going to be different service teams
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.540]   that are going to be spread out,
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.540]   and they're going to just basically show you
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.540]   what's going on at church.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.540]   So if you're a member of the church, please plan to show up to that.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.540]   After you grab lunch, just come back to church at 2.30,
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.540]   and we'll get that started.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.540]   There are other announcements, but I'm going to just ask you guys

[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.540]   And all that information will be there.

[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.540]   Yeah, so I'm going to pray for our offering.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.540]   Right after, we have a special presentation from our sisters,
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.540]   knowing that this is Easter Sunday that we're celebrating.
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.540]   And so if you are new to the church and you have a physical offering
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.540]   you want to give, we have offering basket back over there.
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.540]   Otherwise, we'll give you a minute to give your offering.

[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.540]   So let's pray.
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:37.540]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for what this day means to all of us.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.540]   We thank you for your sacrifice.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.540]   We thank you for suffering on our behalf.

[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.540]   because of what Christ has done.
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.540]   Lord, as we have come before you to celebrate, to remember,
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.540]   to be convicted, to be renewed, and strengthened,
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.540]   I pray that you would anoint this time, Lord God,
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.540]   to help us to gather together to worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:04.540]   May our offering be multiplied for your use 30, 60, 100-fold.
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.540]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:35.540]   We were talking about the preparation of the leaders of Israel and a warning and giving hope to the disciples about his second coming.
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:45.540]   Thursday, Wednesday, we talked about the betrayal and the preparation for Judas to betray Christ.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:55.540]   We were talking about the resurrection and the resurrection of Jesus.

[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:45.540]   The Bible says that if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless.
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:55.540]   If you are not able to prove that the resurrection did not take place, we are to be pitied.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:05.540]   Our faith is completely worthless.

[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:25.540]   We are making these requirements on their life and we would do everything in our power to thwart them from that.

[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:45.540]   This morning, my goal is not to exposit and to give you apologetics information about the proof of the resurrection historically.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:55.540]   I want to give you a journalistic perspective of digging through the proof of the resurrection.
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:34:05.540]   Why it is reasonable to believe that Jesus was resurrected from the dead.
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:15.540]   Let's see who is really hungry for God.

[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:45.540]   Pastor Mark and our outreach team will be out there and they will be explaining.
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:55.540]   We will be able to give you a brief presentation and answer any questions you have.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:35:05.540]   This morning, my goal is not to get into the information in this book, but to take some time to walk through John 11.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:13.540]   The foreshadowing of why Jesus had to die and be resurrected is stated clearly in this text.
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:23.540]   He was raised in Jerusalem.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:33.540]   Let me pray for us and we will jump into the text afterwards.

[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:33.540]   Let's pray.
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:43.540]   Lord, I want to worship you in spirit and truth.
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:53.540]   I want to worship you in spirit and truth.
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:19:03.540]   I want to worship you in spirit and truth.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:13.540]   I want to worship you in spirit and truth.
[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:23.540]   I want to worship you in spirit and truth.
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:33.540]   I want to worship you in spirit and truth.
[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:43.540]   I want to worship you in spirit and truth.
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:53.540]   I want to worship you in spirit and truth.
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:20:03.540]   I want to worship you in spirit and truth.
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:13.540]   I want to worship you in spirit and truth.
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:23.540]   I want to worship you in spirit and truth.
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:33.540]   I want to worship you in spirit and truth.
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:43.540]   Stand up for the closing praise.
[01:20:43.540 --> 01:21:05.540]   (Music playing)
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:13.540]   I love the voice of Jesus on the cross of Calvary.
[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:18.540]   He declares his work is finished.
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:22.540]   He has spoken this hope to me.
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:27.540]   Though the sun has ceased its shining,
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:31.540]   Though the war appeared at last,
[01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:36.540]   Christ had triumphed over evil.
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:40.540]   It was finished upon that cross.
[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:46.540]   (Music playing)
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:53.540]   Now the curse has been broken.
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:58.540]   Jesus paid the price for me.
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:03.540]   All the pardon he has offered
[01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:07.540]   Paid the welcome that I received.
[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:12.540]   Holy I approached my Father
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:16.540]   Clothed in Jesus' righteousness.
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:21.540]   There is no more guilt to carry.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:28.540]   It was finished upon that cross.
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:40.540]   (Music playing)
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:48.540]   Death was once my great opponent.
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:52.540]   Fear once had a hold on me.
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:57.540]   But the Son who died to save us
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:00.540]   Rose that we would be free.
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:07.540]   (Music playing)
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:09.540]   One more time, death was once.
[01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:14.540]   Death was once my great opponent.
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:19.540]   Fear once had a hold on me.
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:23.540]   But the Son who died to save us
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:27.540]   Rose that we would be free.
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:32.540]   Yes he rose that we would be free.
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:37.540]   Free from every man of darkness.
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:42.540]   Free to live and free to die.
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:46.540]   Death is dead and Christ is risen.
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:51.540]   It was finished upon that cross.
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:56.540]   Onward to eternal life.
[01:23:56.540 --> 01:24:00.540]   To my Savior and my God.
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:05.540]   I rejoice in Jesus' name.
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:10.540]   It was finished upon that cross.
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:14.540]   It was finished upon that cross.
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:19.540]   It was finished upon that cross.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:38.540]   (Music playing)
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:41.540]   Let's pray.
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:44.540]   1 Corinthians 15, 20-23.
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:47.540]   But now Christ has been raised from the dead,
[01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:49.540]   the firstfruits of those who are asleep.
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:51.540]   For since by a man came death,
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:54.540]   by a man also came the resurrection of the dead.
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:56.540]   For as in Adam all die,
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:59.540]   so also in Christ all will be made alive.
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:02.540]   But each in his own order, Christ the firstfruits.
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:06.540]   After that, those who are Christ's at his coming.
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:09.540]   Help us, Lord God, to cling to this promise.
[01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:13.540]   To know, Father, that no matter what storm that we are in,
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:15.540]   no matter what storm may come,
[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:19.540]   that you are our hope, that you are the resurrection,
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:21.540]   that you are the life.
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:24.540]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:55.540]   >> Again, as a reminder, there's 15.
[01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:58.540]   (Laughter)
