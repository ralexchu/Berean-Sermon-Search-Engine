[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.800]   Pastor John, in the last podcast you shared with us about preaching in front
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.720]   of 60,000 students in the Georgia Dome recently at Passion 2013, and you're
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.600]   closely connected with Louis Giglio and you've been involved with the Passion
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.320]   Conference for many years. I'm interested to hear from you what your
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.400]   takeaways are from Passion 2013.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:32.480]   I don't abstract Passion 2013 from all the Passions beginning in 1997. I've been
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.680]   to all the major American events and I see Passion not just as an event but as
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.560]   a kind of movement that has lasted and grown, and it all grows out of Isaiah 26
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.440]   8, which is where they get the 268 generation, which says, "Your name and
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.640]   your renown are the desire of our souls," and those two things, renown, the renown
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.600]   of Christ and the desire of the soul, is what binds Louis and me together, Louis
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.600]   Giglio, who oversees Passion. He came to my house in 1997 and we sat down at my
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.880]   dining room table. We didn't know each other and he had heard and read some
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.080]   things and he said, "I'm looking for a person whose whole message revolves
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.440]   around the glory of God in Christ and you seem to me to be one of those," and we
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.280]   talked about Christian hedonism and the relationship between desiring God on the
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.680]   one hand and God being glorified on the other hand, and if you go to their website
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.880]   or if you go to their app and look under who we are, they have almost word for
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.800]   word, "God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied in him." That's what
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.480]   unites Louis and me. That's what the movement is. The movement is not about any
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.080]   particular cause. It's about the fame of Jesus. Louis stood up on the last day of
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.000]   this year's Passion and he said, "You would have to be blind not to know that
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.520]   what this is about is Jesus and the fame of Jesus Christ." You listen to their music
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.000]   and you watch Louis speak. This is about calling a generation, time after time,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.520]   every new student generation to rivet their hearts affection and their minds
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.120]   attention on Jesus Christ and the glory of Jesus Christ, the greatness and
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.320]   grandeur and wisdom, strength and power, blessing, all those things of Jesus
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.280]   Christ. So that's what keeps my heart beating with passion.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.320]   They have focused in the last couple of years now on the human trafficking to
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.920]   try to put feet on our passion for Jesus by saying, "In Jesus' name and for Jesus'
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.520]   sake, we would love to see this human slavery ended." I think that's a
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.640]   beautiful, beautiful cause. One of the reasons I love going back to Passion and
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.720]   being a part of it is that it embodies something I gave in my last sermon on
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.720]   Sorrowful Yet Always Rejoicing. I want so bad to help cultivate in American
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:19.720]   evangelicalism a tone that is not chipper or glib or playful. And in my 17
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.680]   years at Passion, I have never heard a joke from the stage. I've never seen a
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.000]   silly skit from the stage. And that's remarkable when you think about it
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.400]   because a lot of student leaders think, "You've got to yuck it up with college
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.840]   students and be silly as the latest comedian or the latest talk show host in
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.400]   order to make them feel like you're real." And Louie's not like that, and neither is
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.480]   Passion. And 60,000 students are coming for a kind of blood, earnest, singing and
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:03.080]   preaching event that exalts Jesus Christ. I just want to encourage leaders of
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.160]   students that it is possible to take this vision of Sorrowful Yet Always
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.680]   Rejoicing tone and build it into a student ministry.
