[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.920]   The other thing that you should have gotten, if you can...
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.280]   You should have gotten one of these, this paper, this front and back.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.440]   Okay, the front side, there's the orientation we're going to go through real quick.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.840]   I know about at least a third of you are new to this class.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.960]   We're going to go over that and then the bottom part and then the back part, I'll explain
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.960]   a little bit later.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.400]   Those of you who are taking this for the first time.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.520]   How many of you sitting in here have not been in Isaiah up till now?
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.520]   Okay.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.840]   How many have you been in Isaiah?
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.920]   Okay, so it's about a third, yeah, about two-third and one-third.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.000]   So those of you who haven't, I'll explain this in a little bit, but if you don't see
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.720]   one of these in front of you, you should look at the other tables and grab one.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.160]   There was about seven or eight per table, so if you happen to sit in a table where you
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.120]   don't have enough, get one.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.240]   There should be enough.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.120]   There is an attendance sheet.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.800]   We have signed up approximately about 140 people in this class for Wednesday.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.560]   Doesn't mean 140 people are going to show up, right?
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.440]   But usually what happens is there's people who sign up and they can't come.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.240]   I know there's some collegians who are signed up but went home for a couple weeks, right?
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.560]   All right, I just assumed that that's what's going on.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.040]   So I know a few of them that are signed up, they're not going to be.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.000]   I think at least on paper that are committed that are going to come out is probably this
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.800]   number and probably another 10 to 15 more.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.040]   Okay, and then there's some people who may be here who hasn't signed up, they're going
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.040]   to have to sign up.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.260]   So each week, we're going to ask you to do our best to take attendance, okay?
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.520]   So every week, whatever group you're in, I may actually divide it back up.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.120]   When you're in a small group, in your small group take attendance.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.960]   Instead of doing it this way, I'm going to have an attendance sheet on each table and
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.640]   then to have you guys go through all of that, okay?
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.440]   Because we want to keep track.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.600]   Again, this is not to go after you, but we want to keep track to make sure that the bulk
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.760]   of the church are following along in the classes that we're taking.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.000]   And so we're trying to keep track of that generally.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.720]   So for today, if you can sign this up so that I'll know who was here and who was not here
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.000]   so that we can, we can, it can help with small groups and so forth.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.520]   Okay, so please sign up and if you, if your name is not here on the back of it, there
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.320]   is empty space.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.800]   So please put your name and email, okay, on this, on this sheet.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.440]   And each week, just kind of whatever, however we do attendance, please take attendance on
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.560]   this.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.760]   You guys are not on your small group yet.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.680]   I know some of your small groups are already, already in your, maybe it might be the group
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.560]   that you're already in right now.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.600]   So this is for the snack schedule for today.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.440]   Some of you guys may have seen my post on Facebook.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.720]   Martin actually volunteered and so he went and got snacks for us and he used a good chunk
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.360]   of his money to get it.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.540]   So you're going to thank him personally later.
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.780]   So not only did he get it, but he paid for it.
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:21.640]   So if you guys can thank him, but starting from next week, there's nine, please, 10 more
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.640]   meetings.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.880]   So after today, there's 10 more meetings.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.820]   This is going to take us all the way to the end of August.
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.920]   And then that, that, the week that we have family retreat, we're going to have our last
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.960]   session that Wednesday and then we have family retreat and then there's going to be two,
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.520]   three weeks off, two weeks off.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.880]   Okay, so that's what our schedule is.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.940]   So, so that's actually including this week, there's 11 weeks.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.460]   So there's 10 weeks and I went through all the way up to chapter 50 through 66 and it's
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.880]   going to take us all the way through and we'll be done to chapter 66 and then we'll have
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.200]   one, one session where we're going to review everything before we end it.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   Okay.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.360]   All right, so this is going on.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.040]   So I know you guys aren't in your group, but some of you guys who led small group last
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.640]   time and you guys know that your group is most likely going to be one of the groups.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   If you guys can sign up.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.920]   So each week there's two, two slots.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:20.760]   So look at that, there's exactly 20 and there's exactly 20 slots.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   Sovereignty of God.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.760]   Right?
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.260]   God has predestined this.
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.200]   So make sure each week there's two, two small groups who are signed up.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   Okay.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.720]   So if everybody, all the, all the tables right now, if you sign up, there'll be exactly 20
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.720]   groups.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.800]   So make sure you sign up for that.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   Do your best.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.680]   We're going to have to switch some of it around obviously next week when we, when we switch
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.680]   things around.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.480]   But again, because we need, we need to know who's going to bring some snacks next week.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.440]   So even though it's not organized yet until next week, if you guys can do your best to
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.040]   sign up for this and we give it to this table.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.440]   Okay.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.440]   All right.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.120]   So that's kind of like some of you guys who, those of you guys who were with us through
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.560]   the Isaiah study, the first two parts, you know exactly what we're doing.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.700]   The format is going to be exactly the same.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.080]   Those of you who weren't here with us in Isaiah, we're actually starting in chapter 50.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.600]   So you missed the first 49 chapters.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.400]   So by next week, please catch up.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   Okay.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.560]   I'll give you all the notes.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.440]   Isaiah is organized in such a way that you can jump in where we're jumping in and still
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.440]   be able to follow because Isaiah is not written chronologically or like any particular way
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.640]   where if you didn't know what's going on in chapter two, you're not going to figure out
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.680]   what's going on in chapter 10.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.680]   Okay.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.200]   So it's kind of, it's kind of thematic.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.560]   In fact, the theme in the book of Isaiah is so sporadic.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.480]   A lot of people get, again, not conservative evangelical scholars, but a lot of the liberal
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.440]   scholars will look at that and say, Oh, I don't even think it was the same guy who wrote
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.320]   it because it's so sporadic.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.600]   You know, the themes will change all of a sudden.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.280]   Isaiah will be speaking about what's happening presently.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.360]   And then all of a sudden skip a hundred years and talk about some, something going on a
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.360]   hundred years.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.280]   And all of a sudden he'll skip back another hundred years and talk about the current events
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.880]   or what happened in the past.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.000]   So those are you guys who kind of anxious, like, well, I wasn't here for the first 49
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   chapters.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.960]   How am I going to jump in and chapter 50?
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.400]   You'll see once we get going that it's not going to hinder your participation in what's
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.640]   happening from chapter 50 and 66.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.640]   Okay.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.220]   And if you do, you can just let us know and we'll try to answer the questions as much
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.220]   as possible.
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.280]   If you get confused, I guarantee you you're surrounded by other people who are just as
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.280]   confused, right?
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.360]   Even, even the ones who sat through the first 49 chapters, Isaiah is not the easiest book
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.280]   to follow along easily.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.000]   But again, so that's what's going on.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.560]   So that's why we opened it up.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.880]   The reason why we put it together mainly is because Pastor Mark is going to be gone for
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.080]   three weeks in August.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.280]   So he won, he couldn't, he couldn't do it.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.520]   And then we were debating, maybe we should do another book in the summer and catch Isaiah
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.800]   at another time.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.600]   But again, just the way that Isaiah is organized, we can still jump in at chapter 50 and I can,
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.880]   I think you can still get a lot out of it.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.920]   Okay.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.200]   So I'm going to pray for us and we'll start.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.440]   We're going to, we're going to start with the orientation today and I just, I'm just
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.720]   giving you a broad stroke so you can kind of get an idea of the book of Isaiah and where
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.040]   you, where we are.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.520]   I'm not going to go through all the outlines of the 66 chapters that we're going to be
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.760]   covering because that would take too long.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.980]   And then we're going to take some time to do have worship time.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.480]   And after the worship time, I'm going to break you guys up into small group.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.040]   And then after that, your, your meeting is going to break up in your small group, take
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.720]   some time to pray, and then we'll have time for snacks at the end.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.720]   So that's how it's going to be.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.360]   So each day that's sort of going to be the pattern.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.560]   You're going to come in, we're going to take some time to, to go over the questions that
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.560]   you guys had and then and then you'll have small group time.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.560]   Okay.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:05.280]   So after we pray and we'll jump into it.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.440]   Gracious father, we thank you so much for today.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:14.400]   We thank you Lord God for just a love that you pour upon us Lord that we don't deserve.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.200]   And we thank you father God that even in the midst of all distractions that you've given
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.920]   us brothers and sisters that we can run this race together with that, whether we are strong
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.020]   or we are weak, that we belong to this body together.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:35.640]   Help us Lord God to be compassionate, to not to shy away from loving each other, to
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.440]   challenging and even at times confronting.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.440]   But we pray father God that most of all, that in the midst of all of this, as we wrestle
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.960]   together that we would truly do it together.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.120]   So we pray that as we study your word, that you would help us Lord God to jump into it
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.680]   and to glean from it what you've ordained in through the study in Jesus name we pray.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.120]   Amen.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.360]   So today you don't have any notes to fill out because what you have in front of you
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.360]   are not fillers.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.040]   Starting from next week, you'll have fillers so that you can take notes on the things that
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.040]   I'm giving out.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.440]   But today there's no notes to take.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.880]   You can just follow along.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.600]   Okay.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.400]   So the way that this Bible study, again, those of you who've been here, it's review, but
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.360]   the way that this Bible study is organized, it's really for the purpose of establishing
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.360]   daily discipline.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.560]   We're not going to study the book of Isaiah, but the reason why it's organized into small
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.000]   groups the way it is, we're not, we're going to ask you once you commit to the small group,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.900]   but that's the small group that you stay with because part of the Bible study is to establish
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.280]   daily intake of the word of God through the book of Isaiah.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.880]   And that's some of you guys who are already doing quiet time in other passages.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.800]   I encourage you to keep that up.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   Okay.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.040]   I'm not asking you to replace it, but we do want you to get in the habit of looking at
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.920]   this every week that, or daily that you don't come and say, Hey, you know, we're doing two
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.920]   chapters.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:02.000]   I'm going to, I'm going to just cram it Tuesday or Wednesday before I come and then just kind
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.360]   of get a general sense of what Isaiah says.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.740]   If you take time throughout the week and wrestle with what's happening, you'll be able to understand
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.740]   a lot more.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.740]   Okay.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.960]   It's not like Sunday messages where I'm dealing with a very small text and then I'm going
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.120]   to point out to you, this is where I'm getting, this is where I'm getting this word means
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.680]   this, this passage means this.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.680]   Isaiah, I can't do that because we're covering a large portion of the material.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.920]   I can't go and just say, Hey, this passage is from the, this words mean that I'm just
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.960]   going to assume you wrestled with it.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.960]   Right?
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.400]   If I asked you a question on Tuesday in Isaiah, what is the, what is, you know, why does God
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.920]   use the term hammer to describe this?
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.400]   I'm just going to assume that you read it and you dealt with it.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.760]   I'm not going to go back and say, this is how God says this word, you know, in this
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.760]   context.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.480]   So if you come and you haven't done that, um, you're, yeah, you are going to be lost,
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.480]   right?
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.840]   Because I'm not going to take time because it would take too long.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.920]   I won't be able to cover the material if I have to go there and re explain what's already
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.800]   there where I'm expecting you to do.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   Okay.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.360]   So, uh, the focus is to study through the book of Isaiah day to day.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.880]   A goal is also for the purpose of application, practical accountability through small group.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:20.120]   So you'll notice that each of the days there's a practical application, uh, after each day.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.400]   So every day there's a small passage that you'll, you'll find.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:30.420]   And after that passage, so if you look at it, the first day is tomorrow on Thursday.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.920]   And by the way, on the top there's memory verse.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.920]   Okay.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.600]   So you're expected to memorize that.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.160]   And for the next 10 weeks, there's 10 verses.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.160]   It's going to be cumulative.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.480]   And then there's two first day.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.000]   There's four questions, three questions are study questions.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.920]   And then the fourth question is an application of questions.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.920]   Okay.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.200]   So that's what I'm hoping that you guys would meditate on.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.240]   And then when you guys get together, you'll take some time in your small group to discuss
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.240]   that.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.240]   Okay.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.240]   Make sense.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.240]   Okay.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.160]   All right.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.160]   So that's what's going on.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.600]   So each week in your small group, you're going to be going over these questions to answer
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.680]   those questions and then have discussion at the end.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:15.400]   So my hope is that at the end of each day, you'll have some kind of application that
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.600]   you, when you come to your small groups, you're not just coming completely empty handed.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.200]   You're coming and saying, this is what I wrestled with.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.560]   And then, Hey, I have some questions here.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.900]   I was reading this and this doesn't make any sense.
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.880]   And then you'll have some like exegetical questions.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.240]   And then based upon that, have some application of questions or application of things that
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.600]   you guys can discuss.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.600]   Okay.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:43.560]   So remember, if you apply without interpretation, what do we call that?
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.640]   Miscarriage right?
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.440]   Meaning that you're applying things that you just kind of generally, right?
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.160]   And it has to come from interpretation.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.800]   So application has to come from interpretation.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.320]   So if you're not doing the interpretation and saying, you know what, I just want to
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.520]   be a good Christian, then you're just going to apply whatever you think is right in your
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.520]   own mind.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.520]   Right?
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.400]   So interpretation without application, what do we call that?
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.240]   Abortion, right?
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.360]   The point of interpretation is to give birth to something.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.360]   Right?
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.160]   So if you don't apply what you're interpreting, then all it's going to do is going to cause
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.760]   you to be an arrogant Christian.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.920]   Like I know this and I know that.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.120]   So we want application come from interpretation.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.240]   Interpretation always lead to application.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.000]   So every day that we're asking you to study through the word that you would have in mind,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.200]   what does it mean and how do you apply it?
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.200]   Okay?
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.560]   And so small group, we're asking for accountability for that.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.440]   Again, the goal is to establish spiritual disciplines, daily devotions, prayer and purposeful
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.440]   fellowship.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.400]   And so again, your small groups are designed for that purpose.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.200]   Each person will be in small groups.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.920]   It will be 10 weeks, including this week.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.240]   Okay?
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.640]   And you will be committed to that small group.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.520]   So if some of you, okay, that's another thing I'm going to ask you to put on that card.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.200]   If some of you know for sure that you're not going to be able to come consistently, can
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.040]   you put that on your card?
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.600]   You can still attend Bible study, but I have to make sure that you guys are all in one
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   Bible study.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.600]   Okay?
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.200]   Some of you guys have problem with commitment.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.640]   That you just need to mature.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.640]   Okay?
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.280]   You're always saying I'm committed, but you never know until that week.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.880]   That needs to change.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.880]   Okay?
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.000]   So I'm not asking, I'm not asking like, "Eh, we'll see."
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   You know?
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.360]   I'm asking if you're committed to this, to commit to this small group.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.600]   But if you know for a fact that you can't come because of work or distance or whatever,
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.360]   can you mark it on there so that you're kind of spread out into different groups?
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.560]   Okay?
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:50.400]   Again, I said it before it was up there.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.820]   Okay?
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:57.140]   So if you notice, you have Monday through Friday, but Saturday and Sunday is left open.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.980]   So Saturday, Sunday does not mean debauchery day.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.780]   It just means that we've divided it into five days, and then Saturday and Sunday we're leaving
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.780]   it up to you.
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.780]   Right?
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.060]   So if you're doing quiet time or meditation or if you maybe missed, you want to catch
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.020]   up, you can use those days.
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.140]   Okay?
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.940]   Each week there's memory verses.
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:22.800]   That is, again, next week's memory verse is Isaiah 50 verse 4.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.220]   So you'll memorize that, and then when you come back, your small group is going to keep
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.220]   you accountable.
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.500]   And then each week there's going to be a cumulative.
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:35.340]   So you're going to have 10 verses memorized, okay, by the end of this session.
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:39.940]   So the 10 verses that you're memorizing, I'm picking a key verse in those chapters that
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:40.980]   we're studying.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:46.280]   So if you have those 10 verses memorized, at the end, you'll at least have a broad outline
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.620]   of chapter 50 to 66.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.620]   Right?
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:53.920]   And because of that one key verse, and you know what chapter it's in, you'll know generally
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.160]   what that chapter is talking about.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.160]   Okay?
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.960]   So that's how the verses are picked.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.800]   Each week we're going to begin with about 40 minutes of going over instruction.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.600]   Basically, during the 40 minutes, I'm going to be going over the questions that you went
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   through.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.600]   Okay?
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:17.120]   So the questions that are given to you, I'm going to go back and try to highlight certain
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.120]   things.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.560]   Because of the amount of text that we're looking at, I'm not going to be able to get into every
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.560]   detail.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.560]   Right?
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.860]   So, if you're studying and say, "You know, I'm really curious about this.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:33.040]   Maybe it's not one of the questions that we asked, but I really am curious about this."
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.920]   I encourage you to email me before.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.920]   Okay?
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.680]   But don't email me at 659.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.840]   Okay?
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.840]   Email me before.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.760]   Like, if you have a question on Tuesday, just sit there and say, "Oh, I wonder how this
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.760]   should be understood."
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.760]   Just email me.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.840]   So I'll try to incorporate that into the study.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.840]   Okay?
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.120]   But again, you have to email me plenty of time, because I'm not going to be able to
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:17:00.600]   address it if I just get the email right before I come here.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.280]   One last thing.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.160]   Now, this Bible study necessarily isn't designed for this.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.760]   But might as well take advantage of the fact that we're together, you know, and because
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:17.880]   of the size of our church, even in this room, right, I guarantee you at the end of 10 weeks,
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.960]   you're not going to all be singing kumbaya with everybody in this room.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.960]   Right?
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.520]   You're going to know your table, and then whoever happens to be rubbing your shoulders
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.240]   behind you.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.760]   And then if you enjoy the same snacks, and you're always crowding the same table with
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.880]   the same people, those are the people you're going to get to know.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.120]   So we're going to try to encourage you as much as possible to get to know other people.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.600]   But specifically in your small group, this is what we've been doing.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.480]   We're asked that at least have one activity outside.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:52.320]   Maybe you can grab dinner, you know, or some groups went hiking together, some groups,
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.080]   you know, when they had snack times, they got together at people's homes, and they actually
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:00.520]   made stuff together as a form of fellowship and bonding time.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.800]   And so we're asking that through in the 10 weeks that you would be deliberate, and take
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.220]   some time to really fellowship with that group.
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:12.000]   So again, whether it's for snacks, or going out to eat, or doing some activity, that you
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.160]   would take advantage of that.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.960]   And you'll find, if you do it earlier, instead of let's say you have 10 weeks and you did
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.600]   it, oh shoot, forgot to do it, you know, in the 10th week you went out.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:27.240]   It kind of defeats the purpose, because if you have some bonding activity early on, and
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.080]   you happen to be sitting in a small group where you're not really that familiar with
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.800]   everybody, it'll help with your small group.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.200]   People will be more open to open to one another, and pray for each other, keep each other accountable,
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.480]   so again, this is completely based upon your small group though.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.360]   If you happen to be in a small group where everybody's bah humbug, I don't want to get
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.700]   to know you, we're too busy, or whatever, but this is not a mandatory thing, but we're
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.280]   encouraging you to do that.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.920]   Okay, so this is for each of the small groups.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.080]   Any questions on any of this?
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.080]   This is basically a quick orientation.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.760]   All right.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:07.400]   All right, I'm going to go over for the next maybe about 20 minutes the overview of Isaiah.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:12.640]   Okay, so I don't have anywhere for you to take notes, but if you are studious, if you
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.120]   want to, this is where you want to begin to take notes.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.120]   This is the overview.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:24.400]   Oh, and just a quick note, I'm going to be emailing you sometime this week if I'm going
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.280]   to ask you guys, because we have so many more tables than last time, to ask a few of you
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.080]   to help lead the small groups.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.080]   I'm going to be emailing you.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.240]   So if you get that email, if you can respond ASAP.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:41.080]   So if I emailed it tomorrow and I don't get a response until Monday, I'm assuming that
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.040]   for whatever the reason, you're not interested in doing that.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.400]   But even if you're not, please help me, because it makes it much harder if I have to wait
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.240]   till next Tuesday to know who's going to be able to come out or not.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.200]   If you are going to be leading the small group, we're going to be having our first orientation
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.840]   meeting for the leaders next Wednesday.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.560]   Because I didn't give you enough notice, if you absolutely cannot come, I'll understand.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.880]   But I'm giving you the heads up that we're going to try to meet together next Wednesday
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.680]   at 6 o'clock.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.440]   For those of you who are going to be leading the small group.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   The author.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.120]   Obviously, it's called Isaiah because Isaiah is the author.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.960]   He's considered to be either the greatest or one of the greatest prophets of the Old
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.360]   Testament.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.820]   Not simply because of the size of his letter.
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.920]   It's I believe it's second longest letter in the Bible.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.360]   But not necessarily because of the size of the letter, but because of the content.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.360]   Because of what it covers.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.960]   And I'll get to that in a little bit.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.720]   His name means salvation of Jehovah, and that's sort of the name.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.800]   The salvation of Jehovah is sort of the theme of the whole book.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.760]   And so again, we'll get to that in a little bit.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:58.220]   So as you guys know, in the Old Testament in particular, their names are very significant.
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:04.400]   The prophets name or the main characters names are directly tied to what God happens to be
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.100]   doing during that time.
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.840]   So God chooses Isaiah in God's sovereign plan.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:17.680]   His whole theme of the book of Isaiah is about the salvation that God's going to bring.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:23.480]   Isaiah chapter 1 says that he prophesied during the period of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.900]   And those are the four kings.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.320]   So let me ask you guys, let's see how many of you guys remember.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.600]   Is this Northern Kingdom or Southern Kingdom?
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.000]   Southern.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.320]   Okay, Southern Kingdom.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.040]   Southern Kingdom.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.040]   Is he a good guy or bad guy?
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.040]   Bad.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.040]   Good guy?
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.040]   Okay, Uzziah is a good guy.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.040]   Jotham, good guy or bad guy?
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.040]   Bad guy.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.040]   Bad guy.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.040]   Ahaz, good guy or bad guy?
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.040]   Bad guy.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040]   Bad guy.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.040]   Hezekiah, good guy or bad guy?
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.040]   Good.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.040]   Good.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.040]   Good.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.040]   Is he a good guy or bad guy?
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.040]   Good.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.040]   Good guy.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.040]   Okay.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.320]   You think 100 years from now when people see the list of our names and say, "Is this good
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.320]   guy or bad guy?"
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.720]   Good guy or bad guy?
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.120]   Okay, so anyway.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:14.140]   Israel, like the Northern Kingdom is predominantly, all of them are bad kings.
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.120]   In the Southern Kingdom, there's about 8 out of 20-some who are good kings.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.360]   And out of them, these two are actually good kings.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:28.560]   They're good kings, but they were in a period where there was a lot of religious practices,
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.120]   but they were still rebelling against God.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.480]   So in their mind, they were right with God.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:37.680]   Because again, out of predominantly negative kings, two of them were actually good kings.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.880]   Hezekiah is probably one of the best kings of Israel, right?
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:47.240]   But there's this false security of their standing before God because one, they've had a lot
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.800]   of religious and a lot of temple worship and practices, but God comes in.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.400]   What is one of the main themes?
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.560]   Remember in Isaiah chapter 2?
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:01.400]   What does God indict Israel of?
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.320]   Superficial worship, right?
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.800]   That's the passage where Isaiah comes and says, "God, I hate your evil assemblies.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.760]   What are your just noisy songs to me?"
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.520]   And so he's basically indicting superficial worship.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:21.680]   And that's kind of like the period that Isaiah is prophesying in, right?
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.960]   So you'll see a lot of that in Isaiah.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.440]   Quick background information.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:33.400]   Isaiah is referred to as the messianic prophet because of the amount of prophecies of Jesus
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.400]   in Isaiah.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:41.680]   In fact, it has the most prophecies about Jesus than any other prophets.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.280]   Isaiah is quoted in the New Testament more than any other Old Testament prophet.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.400]   There's only one book in the Old Testament that's quoted more than Isaiah in the New
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   Testament.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:57.720]   Anybody guess?
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.720]   Somebody said it, but it was whispered.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.720]   Psalms.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   Okay.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:07.640]   So outside of Psalms, the most quoted prophet in the New Testament of the Old Testament
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.720]   is Isaiah.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.680]   Isaiah ministry began, we see in Isaiah chapter 6, 1 to 3.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.960]   Remember where Isaiah is taken and seen a vision of God where it says it's holy, holy,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.480]   holy, that famous passage.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:27.260]   Again, so this is probably the beginning and the calling of Isaiah.
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:31.360]   So the calling of Isaiah, the context is Uzziah just died.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.440]   So if you look at Isaiah chapter 6, verse 1, it says, "During the period when Uzziah
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.440]   has just died," right?
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.080]   And Isaiah is called.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.080]   The reason why Isaiah is called is because Uzziah, the good king, and so they're kind
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.560]   of anxious that, "Oh, we lost a good king.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.560]   You know, what's going to happen?
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.840]   There's a lot of enemies about to attack Israel."
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:55.040]   And so God is speaking through Isaiah to remind him that the real king is still on the throne.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.080]   Okay?
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.640]   So Isaiah is filled with reminders to the nation of Israel that the real king is still
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.640]   here.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.640]   He's the real king, right?
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.640]   He's the one you ought to fear.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.720]   He's the one that you need to have refuge.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   Okay?
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.720]   He's the one you trust in man.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.600]   So that's a quick overview.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.640]   Some unique features about the book of Isaiah.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:20.720]   It's the only Old Testament book to predict both the virgin birth and his dual nature.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   Okay?
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:26.200]   It is the first of two Old Testament books describing early days of Lucifer before he
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.600]   fell and became the devil.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.600]   The other book is Ezekiel.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.000]   It is the first of two Old Testament books predicting the ministry of John the Baptist.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Okay?
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.640]   So remember the book of Malachi predicts that.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.040]   It records one of the Old Testament's most precise prophecy about an individual, the
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.520]   Persian king Cyrus.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.520]   Okay?
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:53.840]   So those of you guys who were with us in the study before, how many years after Isaiah
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.480]   died does King Cyrus actually come into power?
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.600]   Not exactly, but about?
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.600]   Hundreds of years.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.600]   Huh?
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.600]   So hundreds of years.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.040]   So it was like 150 plus.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.040]   Right?
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.600]   So again, but his name actually appears.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.200]   This is one of the reasons why the secular scholars say, you know, Isaiah could not have
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:21.040]   been an author because, you know, he mentioned Cyrus by name and he was already gone for
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.320]   many, many years.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.320]   Right?
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.000]   But so Isaiah's prophecy actually names that king by name.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Okay?
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.440]   Number five, it gives the most extended overview of the Messiah's mission to both Jews and
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.280]   Gentiles.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.040]   So these are all unique features of the book of Isaiah.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.040]   Okay?
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:43.520]   So those of you guys who, it's a review for you, but you kind of have to know Israel's
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:49.120]   history of briefly that when God established his nation of Israel, Saul's the first king,
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.280]   David his son, Solomon his son.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.240]   Then after Solomon, the kingdom splits in two.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.240]   Right?
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:27:05.080]   And so this, the tribe where the all 10 tribes follow Jeroboam, this is called the what kingdom?
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.040]   This is the Northern kingdom.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.760]   And often in the Bible is referred to just Israel.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.400]   Okay?
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.420]   Sometimes you'll see, oh, Israel did this and, but Judah did that.
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.340]   It's referring to the Northern kingdom.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.640]   And this kingdom only has Judah and the two tribes.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.640]   Okay?
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:29.240]   Oh, sorry, Judah and had to say, what are the, what are the two tribes?
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.560]   Judah and the Benjamites.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.560]   Okay.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.560]   Those are the only two.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:38.320]   That's why Paul, remember when he says, Hey, you know, if you want to boast about the flesh,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.540]   he says, I'm from a tribe of Benjamin, right?
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:47.220]   Because he was prestigious because he stayed with the kingdom that lasted longer than this
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.220]   kingdom.
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.420]   And that's the tribe that the tribe of Judah where the Messiah comes from.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.860]   So to say that you are the only other tribe that you could have said I was better than
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.360]   you is the tribe of Judah, right?
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.680]   The second most prestigious would have been the tribe of Benjamin.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.840]   That's why Paul says, you want to go at it with me?
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.980]   You know, I'm from the tribe of Benjamin, right?
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:12.960]   This is the reason why the split kingdom, the Northern kingdom lasted about 210 years.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:18.680]   It had 19 Kings and all 19 did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.680]   Okay.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.680]   Completely corrupt.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   Right?
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:28.720]   And as a result of that, God allows the Syria to come in and completely demolishes them.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.080]   The Southern kingdom, he referred to as the kingdom of Judah.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.160]   Okay.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.160]   It lasted until 931.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:40.680]   So it's about 110, 120 years longer.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:46.440]   The total number of rulers was 20 and out of them only eight out of 20 were righteous.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.960]   So think about all the Kings in the nation of Israel.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.600]   And so how many do I forget?
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   Right?
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.680]   19 Kings plus 21, right?
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.240]   So that's 30 Kings, right?
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.560]   Did I miss that?
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:05.480]   30, 40 Kings out of 40 Kings, only eight of them were good, right?
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.240]   Only eight of them were good.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:11.360]   So you know, remember when we talk about when God tells the nation of Israel that if you
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.760]   obey me, you'll be blessed.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.800]   If you disobey me, you'll be cursed.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.680]   So think about out of 40, only eight of them and all eight of them were only are part of
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.160]   one kingdom.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:27.880]   So the other kingdom was completely demolished.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:33.240]   And they also go into captivity by the Babylonians in 605 BC.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.240]   So that's Israel's history.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:41.440]   And this is right before Israel goes into, or the Southern kingdom goes into captivity
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.640]   is when Isaiah is prophesying.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.680]   He's prophesying that because of your sins, Babylonians are going to come and take you
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.920]   into captivity.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.160]   Just like the Assyrians did to our brothers up North.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.320]   Okay.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.920]   That's a historical background.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:04.920]   He's prophesying during a period of political turmoil within the nation of Judah.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:10.200]   Northern kingdom has fallen to Syria and now they're in danger of being attacked by, by
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:15.400]   the Babylonians.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:23.240]   So just to kind of give you a quick geography, Israel, this, this area is where Israel dwells
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:30.200]   out of this, like right around Jerusalem, like Judah and Benjamites, they're like right
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   here.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.320]   And then the Southern kingdom or Northern kingdom occupied this space.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.840]   So this is, this is all of Israel is like right here like that.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   Okay.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   Look at Assyria.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:45.520]   Assyria dominated this whole region.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.920]   And then later on, the Babylonians come in and they conquer the Assyrians and they dominate
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.720]   this whole region.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.440]   And if you go more towards South Egypt dominates this area.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:01.480]   So Israel is constantly flanked by their enemies.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:06.880]   And so their concern was Israel was constantly trying to negotiate with the, either the nation
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:13.480]   of Egypt or Babylonians or the Assyrians so that they can basically ally with the big
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.220]   brothers and ask for protection.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.640]   So every time they felt like they were being threatened by the Assyrians, they would run
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.920]   to Egypt and say, we're going to pay you tribute if you protect us.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.920]   Right.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:28.680]   Or they felt, you know, threatened by another nation, they would make treaties with Babylon.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:34.080]   And so Isaiah speaks to the nation of Israel saying that these pagan nations are not your
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.680]   salvation, right?
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.480]   I am your salvation.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.240]   So that's one of the major themes of the book of Isaiah is reminded the nation of Israel
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.040]   that God is your God.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.200]   These people can't protect you.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.560]   In fact, they're also going to be judged for their sins.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.640]   Just like, just like your brothers have.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.560]   It's just another map, right?
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.520]   The Northern kingdom goes into captivity, destroyed by the Assyrians.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.880]   And then the Southern kingdom is destroyed by the Babylonians.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.720]   Okay.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.560]   Okay.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.560]   It's a broad outline.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.720]   I'm not going to go through all of it.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:14.160]   It's divided into two major sections, chapter one through 39, predominantly about judgment.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:18.000]   Like why is Israel being judged?
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Right.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.880]   So not all of it, there's messianic prophecies in there too, but predominantly.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:29.760]   So those of you guys who think like, you know, the missed the first 40, 49 chapters, it's
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.600]   predominantly, it's been about judgment.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.600]   Okay.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:38.000]   And then chapter 40 to 66 is the promise of deliverance.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.040]   So it's kind of like, you know, those of you as we've been following the book of Romans,
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.560]   it's really split just like the gospel, right?
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:52.120]   He's established the foundation of why God is judging and then provides the Messiah as
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.120]   the answer.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.120]   Okay.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.120]   And that's the second part.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:59.120]   So just like Paul lays out the first four or five chapters of all I've seen and fall
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:03.680]   short of the glory of God, and then he begins to go into starting from chapter, the latter
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:08.680]   part of chapter five and six, and then begin to introduce Christ as a solution to our sins.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:13.760]   That's exactly how book of Isaiah is, is situated.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.180]   First part is laying foundation.
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.960]   This is why God's judgment is coming.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.720]   And then Jesus has the answer to your sins.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.720]   Okay.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:32.800]   Let's skip over that.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.960]   I'm not going to go through all of this just to kind of give you an idea.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.500]   And this is not all of it.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:43.400]   These are all the different prophecies that are in the book of Isaiah about the Messiah.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.440]   And again, this is not all of it.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:51.000]   There's more, but again, this is why this is the reason why they consider Isaiah the
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.820]   biggest or the greatest, most important prophet of the old Testament, because he does the
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.840]   biggest work preparing the way of coming out of Christ.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:03.800]   So he's very specific about the virgin birth, about Galilean ministry, about how he was
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.520]   going to be struck, right?
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.800]   Why Jesus gets struck.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.640]   He's going to be widely rejected.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.280]   He's going to be siding among the accusers, Isaiah 53, right?
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.600]   He's going to be buried with the rich man.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.120]   So all of these things are prophecies that come straight out of the book of Isaiah.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:26.000]   So if you'll notice, predominantly it's from chapter 50 and on.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Okay?
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.100]   Predominantly.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:32.800]   So we're heading into a section starting from chapter 50 where there's going to be a lot
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.880]   of prophecies about the Messiah.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.380]   And that's why we're taking it a little bit slower than before, especially when we come
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:43.400]   to these, like chapter 53 is not a chapter we want to just lump with other chapters.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:48.440]   We're going to take our time to go through that chapter because it's so rich in theology
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.120]   and pointing to Christ.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.120]   Okay?
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.120]   So that's the broad outline.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.120]   Okay.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.120]   I think that's, okay.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.120]   All right.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.360]   I know like we went over it real quick.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:03.960]   If some of you guys want this, email it to me and I'll forward it to you.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.880]   If you guys want to, you know, Hey, I got nothing to do all week and I just want to
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.840]   be studious and catch up.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.640]   I'll email this to you so you can kind of review it during the week before you come
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.080]   if it's going to help out.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.080]   Okay.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.360]   But I don't have any printouts of this.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.320]   So you guys can just email me.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.320]   Okay.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.240]   If you don't know my email, it's on the website.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.400]   Or if you look at the church program, my email is on the bottom of that list.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:36.360]   Also another thing, if you guys want electronic copies of this, you know what?
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.360]   Forget it.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.360]   I'm going to email it to everybody.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.360]   Okay.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.000]   I'm just going to add whoever's on the list.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   I'm just going to email it to everybody.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.880]   And then if you're like, stop sending me this stuff, then email me.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:48.880]   Okay.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.880]   I think that made me easier.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.480]   Instead of waiting for you to email me, I'll just send it out to everybody, but I'm going
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.480]   to copy it anyway.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.040]   I'm going to have these things copied and then you're going to be able to take notes
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.040]   on it.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.600]   And I know some of you guys are like me.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.280]   I'd rather write with pen than on the whatever it is you have.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.280]   Okay.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:10.400]   So I'll still have the physical copies, but I'll email it to everybody.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.400]   All right.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:16.840]   So what I wanted to do for the rest of the time is I'm going to have you guys take some
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.360]   time to get into your small group.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:24.600]   But before we did that, I want to take some time to worship together.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.120]   You know, we haven't done that on Wednesday, Bible study.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:34.720]   And again, the theme of the worship songs, I try to pick deliberately so that it'll kind
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.280]   of fit along with.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.600]   Okay.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.800]   I need somebody to do this for me.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   Somebody that I can trust is not going to fall asleep today.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.960]   Okay.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.960]   Somebody in the front then.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.960]   Okay.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:55.040]   There's only one slide where you actually have to go forward and backward.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.040]   Okay.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:01.520]   Brian, can you turn this on?
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.280]   (coffee pouring)
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:18.020]   - Okay.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.180]   (microphone thudding)
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:40.980]   All right.
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:46.980]   You know, sometimes when we, you know, most,
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.700]   this is a general observation that I've seen.
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.900]   That when you go to like a church that emphasizes the Bible,
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.860]   for whatever the reason,
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:38:00.020]   it kind of tends to move away from emotions.
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.700]   That we think like it's not, it's not as relevant
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.860]   because as long as we have our theology correct,
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.980]   our emotional expression toward God isn't as important.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.540]   Absolutely wrong.
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.060]   Absolutely wrong.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.820]   You know, our passionate worship of God
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.580]   is just as important as getting the right doctrine
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.620]   because that's our way of expressing the point.
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.740]   The reason why the glory of God is revealed to us
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.900]   is so that we may be affected by that glory
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.380]   and return in giving thanks and worship.
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.300]   So if the worship part doesn't take place,
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.860]   all it becomes is, "Wow, that was interesting."
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:33.700]   Right?
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:34.520]   That's all it becomes.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.420]   It just becomes a lot of people who are intrigued
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.500]   by the knowledge of God and not affected.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.460]   So I wanted to, again, take some time to just,
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.700]   asking you guys to prepare your hearts
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.780]   and that you would come prepared.
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.020]   Now, again, I'm not gonna promise
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.700]   that we're gonna do this every week.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.660]   I'm gonna see if I'm able to do it.
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.980]   And you might not want me to after today.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.940]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.260]   Okay?
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.060]   But it really is for the purpose
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.580]   of trying to encourage the church
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.580]   that worship is important.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.780]   And I'm not just talking about Wednesday,
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.660]   I'm talking about Sundays as well.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:08.700]   You know, when we come together,
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.780]   our active expression of our love toward God
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.860]   and what he's done, like individually,
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.500]   not just like, "Oh, we're doing this as a church."
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.220]   But you individually come to worship God
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.500]   is absolutely important.
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.180]   So I kind of organized the songs
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:24.540]   that would fit the theme of what we're studying.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.540]   If somebody can turn your Bible to Isaiah chapter six.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.500]   Okay?
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.340]   Somebody with a loud,
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.820]   was it not loud?
[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:39.420]   Like, good, hefty voice.
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.500]   If you can read that out loud for us.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.780]   Isaiah chapter six, one, two, and three.
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.140]   Mitchell, can you do that for us?
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:47.980]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:52.100]   (muffled speaking)
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:55.020]   (muffled speaking)
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:40:19.860]   Okay, you just stop there.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:23.300]   So Isaiah six is where Isaiah encounters God
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.020]   and he falls down and he's in all of God.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.580]   And he says, "I am ruined.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.180]   I'm a man of unclean lips.
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.300]   I've seen from a people of unclean lips."
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.300]   And then God touches his mouth with coal
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.620]   and then refreshes him.
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.020]   And he says, "Who's gonna go for me?
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.220]   Here am I, send me."
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.660]   So that was his preparation, right?
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.380]   It wasn't years of training.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.620]   It wasn't years of make sure you do this.
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.540]   It was just encountering God, right?
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:49.700]   And so God was gonna show who he is
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.780]   because that's exactly who he needed to convey.
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.900]   He needed to be a witness of the glory of God.
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.580]   And that's what basically what a prophet is.
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:00.300]   So again, the purpose of what we're doing
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.780]   is as we're starting to the book of Isaiah
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:05.180]   so that we may get a glimpse of his heart,
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.220]   his attribute, who he is, right?
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.740]   Why would he take a bunch of sinners,
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:15.140]   like say, spend 39 chapters expositing in detail
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.700]   their sin, right?
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.300]   Their internal sin, external sin,
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.420]   their sin as a nation, prostitution,
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.260]   how they viewed money.
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.180]   So every way they're guilty.
[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:26.100]   And yet the conclusion of that is therefore,
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.820]   this is the reason why the Messiah is coming, right?
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.620]   But it begins, Isaiah ministry begins
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:31.940]   when he encounters God.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.500]   So that's the song that we're gonna be singing,
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.580]   "I See the Lord."
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.700]   It's not exactly that passage,
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.300]   but again, the theme is similar.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.700]   ♪ I see the Lord ♪
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:49.700]   ♪ I see it on the cross ♪

[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:36.880]   Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:42.720]   is the Lord.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:44:00.720]   Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:07.200]   is the Lord.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:14.500]   The second song that we're seeing, Salvation Belongs to the Lord.
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.500]   Again, this is one of the major themes in the book of Isaiah.
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:21.120]   The word salvation in the Old Testament is used 33 times
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:25.160]   and out of the 33 times, 26 times is in Isaiah alone.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.620]   So again, that's the that's the main theme is that our tendency
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:33.040]   is to run to different things, to money, people, circumstance.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:37.120]   And so Isaiah, God is telling the nation of Israel
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.120]   through Isaiah that he is our salvation, he's our refuge.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:44.040]   So that's what this song about salvation.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:53.580]   Salvation belongs to our God
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:45:00.780]   who sits upon the throne
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:07.000]   and unto the Lamb.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:13.500]   Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks,
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:19.080]   honor and power and strength.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:26.160]   Be to our God forever and ever.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:32.460]   Be to our God forever and ever.
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:38.740]   Be to our God forever and ever.
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.740]   Amen.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.300]   And we, the redeemed, shall be strong
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:57.260]   in purpose and unity,
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:03.340]   declaring aloud
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:09.880]   praise and glory, wisdom and thanks,
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:15.380]   honor and power and strength.
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:22.640]   Be to our God forever and ever.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:28.880]   Be to our God forever and ever.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:35.180]   Be to our God forever and ever.
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.500]   Amen.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:48.300]   So the next one, I don't know the title of this song,
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:53.760]   but it's there in the newborn cry again, it's about the cross
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.220]   and how all of that affects every aspect of our lives.
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:59.420]   So if you look at the prophecy of the Messiah,
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.840]   he doesn't just say, I'm coming to save you from your sins.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.640]   He says, you know, when you're in trouble, you know, when you're
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.760]   when you're anxious, when you have enemies who have surrounded you,
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:15.060]   when you are hungry and and through all of these things,
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.800]   God prophesies a solution is coming right in.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   The solution is always Messiah.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.640]   So all throughout the book of Isaiah is like every different circumstance,
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.100]   whether you're young or whether you're old, whether you're rich,
[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.100]   whether you're poor, that in the end, Christ is a solution.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:32.140]   And so that's what this song ultimately is about in every aspect of life
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:34.140]   that we see glimpses of the cross.
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:53.280]   I. There in the light of every sunrise.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:02.240]   There in the shadow of the slide. Great.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:07.740]   There on the mountain top.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:14.240]   There in the everyday and the Monday.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:20.240]   There in the sorrow and the dancing.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:31.040]   Your great. Such. From the creation to the.
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:41.660]   Then from the cross into eternity, your grace finds me.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:45.660]   Yes, your grace.
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:47.660]   Finds me.
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:54.660]   There on a wedding day.
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:49:01.160]   There in the weeping by the graveside.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:06.660]   There in the very breath we breathe.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:14.660]   Great. Same for the rich and poor.
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:20.660]   Same for the saints and for the sinner.
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:25.660]   Not for this whole wide world.
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:30.660]   Your great. Such.
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:36.660]   From the creation to the.
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:42.660]   Then from the cross into eternity.
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:46.660]   Your grace finds me.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:50.660]   Yes, your grace.
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.660]   Finds me.
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:50:04.660]   It's there in the newborn.
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.660]   Is there in the newborn?
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:09.660]   There in the newborn.
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:16.660]   There in the light of every sunrise.
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:21.660]   There in the shadows of the slide.
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.660]   Your great.
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:29.660]   There on the mountain top.
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:36.660]   There in the everyday and the Monday.
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:41.660]   There in the sorrows of the dancing.
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:45.660]   Great. Such.
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:56.660]   OK, so the last song that we're going to sing before I ask you guys to get in your smoke, make me a prayer.
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:01.660]   So, again, the whole purpose of all of this revelation is that we would be the light to the world.
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:03.660]   So this is a prayer. Make me a prayer.
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.660]   Let my prayers be a cry. And then the second part, we're just going to sing.
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:13.660]   Make us a prayer and let our prayers be a cry so that this would be the main theme of what we do each week.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:18.660]   That our glimpse of who he is would lead us to a greater worship of his name.
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:21.660]   But ultimately to cry out for our generation.
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:25.660]   And then I'm going to ask you guys to take some time to pray with your group.
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:33.660]   Maybe a prayer.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:37.660]   Let my prayers be a cry.
[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:45.660]   Humble my heart so that you may draw.
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:55.660]   Cause me to stand and cry out for this land.
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:04.660]   Cause me to be one who set free.
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:10.660]   To stand as a house of prayer.
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:13.660]   Let me be a prayer.
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:17.660]   Make me a prayer.
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:21.660]   Let my prayers be a cry.
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:30.660]   Humble my heart so that you may draw.
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:39.660]   Cause me to stand and cry out for this land.
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:47.660]   Cause me to be one who set free.
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:54.660]   To stand as a house of prayer.
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:56.660]   Make us a prayer.
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:00.660]   Make us a prayer.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:04.660]   Let our prayers be a cry.
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:12.660]   Humble our heart so that you may draw.
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:21.660]   Cause us to stand and cry out for this land.
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:29.660]   Cause us to be one who set free.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:37.660]   To stand as a house of prayer.
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:39.660]   Let's pray.
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:45.660]   Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for your love.
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:47.660]   We thank you for your patience.
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:52.660]   We thank you for opening our eyes that we may see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:58.660]   That we may not simply work hard but to give a reasonable response.
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:01.660]   To allowing us to hear your voice.
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:04.660]   And desiring Lord God to be near you.
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:06.660]   You know our struggles.
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.660]   You know how easily we get entangled.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.660]   Even now Lord God there are sins that we wrestle with.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:16.660]   I pray that as you brought us together that our community would not be just a social place.
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.660]   But a place where we are actively pursuing one another.
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:21.660]   As we have been pursued by you.
[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:23.660]   I pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.660]   As we take some time to pray and to encourage one another.
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:29.660]   That we really would find encouragement Lord God to love you more.
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:31.660]   In Jesus name we pray.
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:33.660]   Amen.
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.660]   If you can put up the next slide.
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:40.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:45.660]   So just a quick reminder for prayer.
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.660]   If you can take some time to pray with your small groups.
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.660]   Your personal prayer requests.
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:54.660]   Again I want you guys to take time specifically about where you are spiritually.
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:59.660]   And I know that a lot of you guys are in the context of other things going on in your life.
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:02.660]   Whether it may be health or maybe job or relational issues.
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:08.660]   But I want you guys to take time specifically on that particular topic of where you are spiritually.
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:12.660]   And I know probably those things may be affecting it.
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:15.660]   But if you guys can just kind of focus your attention on that.
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.660]   So that you guys would have an idea of where you are spiritually.
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:23.660]   And don't just say you know I've been reading my Bible or I've been doing quiet time.
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:26.660]   Because that sometimes is not a good measure of where you are.
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:28.660]   It could be.
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:30.660]   But you could be doing all of that and have your heart completely away from God.
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:33.660]   So if you guys can be open and honest with each other about that.
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:35.660]   Pray also for the study of Isaiah.
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.660]   The next 10 weeks that we have together.
[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:39.660]   That you would really come.
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:42.660]   Just kind of like hey I'm a member so I have to come to Wednesday Bible study.
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:47.660]   But really come digging, asking questions so that you can maximize our time together.
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:53.660]   That each week when you leave that you would really find encouragement and strength to live the rest of the week for Christ.
[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:55.660]   So if you guys can take some time to pray for that.
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.660]   Pray for our building.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:59.660]   Those of you who came out on Monday we really appreciate you.
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:01.660]   Hopefully we don't have to do it again.
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:03.660]   But if we do I'll email it out.
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.660]   If by Monday you don't see anything.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.660]   Monday night or Tuesday night you don't see anything.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:09.660]   That means there was no appeal.
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:12.660]   That means we're going to end up closing on this property.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:18.660]   And that means our weekday Bible study is going to have to be moved to our new building in 2 to 3 weeks.
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:20.660]   But I'll give you a heads up on that.
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:23.660]   If you guys can take some time to pray for that so that all that stuff will go smoothly.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:26.660]   Then obviously our last prayer request is for Emily.
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:30.660]   I'm not going to go for the sake of time too much detail.
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:36.660]   But right now I think starting Monday she started radiation and a very intense form of chemotherapy.
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.660]   It's not like the regular one.
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:43.660]   And this is the only thing that she has done that has made any kind of impact on her in the past.
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.660]   So they're going back to that this week.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.660]   So they're doing that I think the rest of this week and then they're going to see what happens.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:51.660]   So if you guys can take some time to pray for that for the family as well.
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:52.660]   Okay.
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.660]   So if you guys can take some time to do that.
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:57.660]   I'm going to set up somewhere probably in the back.
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:01.660]   And then so this group will be over and I'm going to be walking around collecting those cards.
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:04.660]   So if you guys can have it on one side so I can come and collect it.
