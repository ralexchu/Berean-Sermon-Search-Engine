[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.500]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your living word.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.140]   We thank you, Father God, that we have brothers and sisters in our small group in this Bible
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.640]   study in the church that we can run this race together.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.680]   Help us, Lord, to be stronger because of our fellowship.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.960]   We pray that our time in your word would sharpen us, encourage us, rebuke us, and that we may
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.240]   be built up as a result of our time.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.040]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.600]   Alright, so the text that we're looking at today in verse 9 through 15 in Colossians
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.600]   chapter 2, if you've done your study or did your homework before you came in, you should
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.600]   have been overwhelmed.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.520]   Okay, so if you came here today not overwhelmed, it probably means that you maybe didn't put
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.920]   as much time, you didn't really dig as much as you should have because every single line
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.480]   in this text is so rich in theology.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:14.960]   I would say outside of Romans and the book of Hebrews, and not including the apocalyptic
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.120]   writing in the book of Revelation, Colossians is probably one of the richest in theology.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.560]   And in this text in particular, in chapter 2, there's so much in here.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.120]   We can probably just wrestle with this text just several months because every single line
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.120]   is so significant.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.880]   Now, I told you that in the beginning that the goal of our study is not for me to unpack
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.040]   everything and then present it to you and this is what this means, this is what that
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.040]   means.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.660]   My goal is to guide you through so that you can learn how to do inductive Bible study
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.660]   on your own.
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.040]   So my hope is that what I am highlighting will kind of point you to the right direction
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.560]   and that more deeper discussions will be happening in your small group and even by yourself and
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.080]   with your friends as well.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.600]   We want to start with a hermeneutical principle and this was something that we did mention
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.040]   before but I wanted to highlight.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.240]   Scripture must interpret Scripture.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.520]   When a particular word, phrase, or thought seems to be ambiguous, we must turn to other
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.160]   passages to help us interpret what is being said.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.120]   Developing an important doctrine based upon one word or phrase or passage often leads
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.500]   to a misunderstanding and often heretical doctrines.
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.840]   So bad doctrine comes from certain passages where you're just kind of taking that passage
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.200]   out of context, out of context of that text and out of context of that culture, out of
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.300]   context of that person's writing.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.580]   So I'll give you an example in Colossians chapter 2, 11.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.360]   It says, "And in him you were all circumcised with circumcision made without hands in the
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.840]   removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ."
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:00.300]   So that phrase, "removal of the body of the flesh," what does that mean?
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.400]   So if you're not careful, you can add meaning to this text.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.980]   Remember what was happening during this period?
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.820]   Remember we said in the beginning there's two false doctrines that was challenging the
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.120]   gospel in the earlier church?
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.060]   Remember what they were?
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.520]   The first were the Judaizers, right?
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.760]   They were basically adding Christ to Judaism.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.660]   You need to be a Jew, you need to be circumcised, you need to observe all the law, and then
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.660]   you need to worship Christ.
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.180]   You need to become a Jew before you become a Christian.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.980]   So those were the Judaizers.
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.020]   So much of Paul's writings and Peter's writings deals with that false teaching.
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.260]   What was the other side with the Gentiles?
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.260]   The Gnostics, right?
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.180]   And what was the false teaching of the Gnostics generally?
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.340]   Flesh is evil, right?
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.340]   Spirit is good.
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.140]   So they separated these two things.
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.260]   So one of the things that came out of that was because the flesh is evil, Jesus could
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.680]   not have come in the flesh, right?
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.940]   So he only appeared in the flesh, or he wasn't really in the flesh, he really wasn't fully
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.940]   man.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.980]   And then what came out of that was we were saved in our spirit and our flesh was separated,
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.260]   so we are saved in the spirit, but our flesh is condemned.
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.100]   So therefore you can do whatever you want with the flesh.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.980]   Okay, do you understand the logic?
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.700]   So the logic that they used was since our flesh is evil and it is condemned, what we
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.940]   do in the flesh doesn't matter because God condemned it and we're going to be saved in
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.100]   the spirit.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.060]   And so 1 John deals with that, right?
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.020]   If you live in the darkness, you say you have fellowship with God, you fool yourself, right?
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.620]   And then he talks about how he who declares Christ to have come in the flesh, he's the
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.260]   one who is born of God, because that was coming from false teaching of the Gnostics.
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.260]   So when he says here that we've been circumcised without hands in the removal of the body of
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.020]   the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, how do you think the Gnostics would have taken
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.020]   this?
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.020]   You see?
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.860]   Here it is right here, right?
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.180]   Paul says that our flesh is removed, so we can do whatever we want.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.020]   So at that time, my guess is the Gnostics would have taken this and run with it.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:27.340]   And so we need to make sure that we understand what he means by this.
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.000]   And this is where the cross references come in and what has Paul said in the other passages
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.780]   in similar manner.
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:42.700]   So again, if you can turn to Romans 6.6, and somebody way in the back, if you can just
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:54.700]   yell out, okay, or read it out for us, Romans 6.6 and somebody also back there Romans 7.24.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:06.420]   Okay, so over there in 6.6, what is called the flesh?
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.180]   Our old self, right?
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.940]   Okay Romans 7.24.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.460]   Somebody?
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:30.860]   Okay, so here it calls the body of death.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:41.580]   Colossians 5.24.
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.540]   If you're there, can you just read out for, and then somebody read Colossians 3.5 for
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.540]   us.
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:59.860]   Sorry, can you read that a little bit louder?
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:12.340]   Okay, so here it says flesh with passion and desires.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:26.420]   Okay Colossians 3.5.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:32.580]   Alright so when you look at the way Paul has used the term flesh, when you look at the
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:38.860]   cross references, what is he referring to when he says he's put to death the body of
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.700]   the flesh?
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.460]   The sinful part of it, right?
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.900]   His sinful nature.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.460]   So he's not saying physically he's put somebody to death.
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.980]   Obviously that's not what he's talking about.
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.020]   Paul himself is still living.
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:00.580]   He's talking about the part of our body that causes us to sin, right?
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.660]   So we've, when it says in Corinthians 5.17 that if any man is in Christ, he is a new
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.660]   creation.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.680]   The old has passed, behold a new has come.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.220]   What is the old that has passed?
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:16.580]   His old nature that bound him to sin and delivered us into a new self.
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:23.060]   That's why the term that Jesus uses is he needs to be born again, right?
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:31.700]   So do Christians have a sinful nature?
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.780]   Do Christians in, are we bound to sin?
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.560]   Are we enslaved to sin?
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:45.720]   So do we have a sinful nature?
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.260]   We do not have a sinful nature, right?
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.020]   We are still in the flesh, but we have been delivered.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.700]   We are no longer enslaved to sin, but we are enslaved to what?
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.460]   Righteousness, right?
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.760]   We are, we have been saved, we are being saved.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:07.220]   But at the core of who we are, we are now enslaved to righteousness.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.460]   Okay?
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.200]   Now some of you guys are saying, "Well, I don't feel like it."
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.060]   If you have genuine faith, you cannot live in sin continually.
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.820]   Because the Holy Spirit will not allow you to.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:26.780]   So as much as you may feel like you are struggling with sin, the Holy Spirit will not allow you
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.180]   to be in sin.
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:35.180]   That's why it says in 1 John, when you, if you live in sin, you do not have fellowship
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.580]   with God.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.780]   Right?
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.140]   You do not have fellowship with God.
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.940]   Because the Holy Spirit will not allow you to.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:47.700]   The fact that there is a huge difference between someone who is struggling with sin and someone
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.340]   who is living in sin.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:56.540]   Someone who is living in sin is somebody, his nature is causing him to continue to sin.
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.740]   Right?
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:03.240]   Someone who has a, someone who has been delivered from that, he may be struggling with purity.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.660]   He may be struggling with unrighteousness.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:11.420]   But that struggle is there because the Holy Spirit is fighting you to come out of it.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.740]   Does that make any sense?
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.660]   And I've used this illustration many times before in a sermon.
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.980]   If you are a possum, you are not comfortable at night.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.540]   During the day I mean.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.920]   Right?
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:31.980]   So if by nature you are a creature of the night, if you happen to fall out of the tree
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:37.380]   because your tail was weak that day, and the first thing you're going to do is look for
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.380]   darkness.
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.380]   Right?
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.300]   Now, is he walking?
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.300]   Is he functioning?
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.300]   Yes.
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.300]   But he doesn't belong there.
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.220]   He feels comfortable in darkness.
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.220]   Right?
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.540]   We're creatures of the day.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.620]   If you turn off the light, what's the first thing that we try to do?
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.980]   Look for a flashlight.
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.980]   Unless we're sleeping.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.980]   Right?
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.540]   We're looking for a flashlight because we need light to function.
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:05.660]   So for Christians, our nature has changed so that we are creatures of the day now, not
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.260]   of the night.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:13.620]   So we may stumble in darkness at times, but if you are, if you genuinely have faith, your
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:18.780]   faith will not allow you to feel comfortable in the darkness.
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.460]   Does that make sense?
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:27.300]   So when he says we have removal of the body of the flesh, our sinful nature that causes
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.860]   us to long for darkness has been put away.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.380]   Right?
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.940]   So that's why there's a difference between when somebody says, "I'm struggling with sin."
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:41.100]   There's a difference when somebody is struggling with sin who in words they're struggling,
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.540]   but in life they're not really struggling.
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.980]   They feel very comfortable there.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:45.980]   Right?
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.820]   They say, "Don't judge me.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:49.820]   I feel comfortable.
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.940]   I don't want anybody calling me out on my sin."
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.660]   A Christian wants accountability.
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.780]   Right?
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.580]   A Christian wants accountability because you're longing to be in the light.
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.180]   Right?
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.100]   Alright.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.180]   So when we're interpreting scripture, you have to make sure that your understanding
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:13.820]   of that text is helped or clarified by the rest of scripture.
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.300]   You don't take that one verse, "Look what he said," and so you just dissect that like
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.300]   what he said.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.300]   Right?
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.340]   And a lot of fights happen even between human beings like this.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.340]   Right?
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.820]   You said this, but you know that's not what I meant.
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.780]   But you said this, you used this word, but I didn't mean that.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.780]   Right?
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.140]   And so if you start to argue with somebody because of a word that was said and you take
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.340]   that out of context, you're not having a discussion.
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.340]   Right?
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.340]   You're a lawyer trying to accuse that person based upon the words that were used.
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.060]   And that's not a good way to communicate.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.060]   Right?
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.500]   And it is not a good way to understand scripture.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.140]   You have to understand it within the context of what he meant.
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.380]   Right?
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.460]   Okay.
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:04.660]   What are some repeated words or related words, okay, before we do anything else, so that
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.300]   we can see the thought flow?
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.220]   Okay.
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.860]   What's the first thing that comes up to you?
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.860]   In him.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.860]   Right?
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.500]   We see in him and in him and in him.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.420]   Right?
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.140]   Or related words.
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.460]   Okay.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.500]   Let's do this first.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.940]   With him.
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.140]   With him.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.140]   Raised him.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.460]   Okay.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.860]   Then with him.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:49.820]   Tell me if I missed something.
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.820]   Through him.
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.820]   Did I miss anything?
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.380]   Okay.
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.820]   So it's clear.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:02.380]   All throughout this text, through him, in him, of him, for him, like over and over again.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.380]   Right?
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.940]   So here we're talking about Jesus' identity and what he has done.
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:07.940]   Right?
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.260]   What did God accomplish through Jesus?
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.460]   That's the theme.
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:17.300]   Anything else that pops up?
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.500]   What are some other words?
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.220]   Okay.
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.860]   Circumcision.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.900]   Circumcised, circumcision, circumcision.
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.060]   Okay.
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.140]   Anything else?
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.140]   Or uncircumcision?
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.140]   Where is that?
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.660]   Yeah, right there.
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.180]   Yep, thank you.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:52.100]   I feel like all the strength is on this side.
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.300]   It's very quiet on this side.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.180]   Okay.
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.180]   What else?
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.180]   Huh?
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.180]   Having.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.180]   Okay.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.180]   Having been.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.180]   Right?
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.180]   Having.
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:15.180]   Verse 10, did I miss it?
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:20.180]   Have been.
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.180]   Having.
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.180]   Okay.
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:29.180]   Having male.
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.180]   Having triumph.
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.180]   Okay.
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.180]   So what does this tell you?
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.180]   Right?
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.180]   Right.
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.180]   Something happened and it resulted in this.
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.180]   Or as a result of this, this happened.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.180]   Right?
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:49.180]   So it's giving you the reason behind what happened.
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.180]   Right?
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:58.180]   So if you were to just look at the words that's been repeated over, you can say that, again,
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:04.700]   how you may have outlined it may look different, but the outline here to me is this first section
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:12.020]   is what Jesus.
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:17.180]   And then the second part of it all throughout this is how.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.740]   Okay?
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:23.700]   Again, you don't have to outline it like that, but broadly just to kind of get to see the
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.780]   flow.
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:30.940]   It's for him, for in him, and in him, and in him, this happened, this happened, this
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.940]   happened.
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.980]   Having been done this, having forgiven, having canceled.
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:40.580]   So if you look at the general flow of thought and you see the words that are repeated, right?
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.380]   What did Jesus do and how did he do it?
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.380]   Right?
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.900]   All right.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:51.620]   So, if we were to go look at the outline, what did he do?
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:56.180]   He begins by saying in verse 9, the fullness of the deity dwells in bodily form.
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:00.500]   He starts by basically identifying Jesus, again, in his bodily form.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:06.500]   It wasn't like Jesus in his manhood and then Jesus and his deity were two separate people.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.500]   Right?
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.340]   Just as God the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit are three in one, Jesus' deity and
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:16.220]   his man, humanity, is one.
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:21.300]   He says all of his deity, not parts of it, not just a reflection of it, but his full
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.220]   deity rested in his human form.
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.220]   Okay?
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.660]   Now, if that's confusing, it's because it is confusing.
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.900]   But that's how the Bible declared who Christ was.
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:41.380]   Just like the Trinity, there is a dual nature of Christ in his humanity and his deity.
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.580]   Okay?
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:52.020]   Now, having said that, there's one thing that is here that the word is repeated and
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:18:00.300]   you probably didn't catch it in your translation, but the word fullness and the word complete
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.460]   has the same root word.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.740]   Okay?
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:10.020]   Comes from the Greek word pleru.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.740]   That's the verse that is used in Ephesians where it says to be filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.740]   right?
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.740]   To full capacity.
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.060]   So, Jesus was full in his deity, in his bodily form.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.060]   Right?
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:28.500]   So, you don't catch it in the English, but in the Greek, it's pretty clear that what
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:33.620]   he means by that is because he was full, he made you full.
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.140]   Okay?
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:41.020]   The English word used here is complete, but in the Greek, it's the same root word.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.380]   So, the reason why he starts with the word that Jesus is fullness is because ultimately
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.980]   he made you full and he is the head over all the rule and authority.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.100]   Right?
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:19:00.380]   He was able to do that because there's nothing above him.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.020]   And I've used his fullness and full.
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.020]   Right?
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.140]   So, I know he's better than that one.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.140]   Okay?
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:16.580]   Because, you know, the word complete is a very rich theological word in the New Testament.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:22.100]   And the word that is used, not here, but used in other parts is the word teleos.
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:28.380]   You know, in 1 Corinthians 10, it says when the...
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.380]   What's the word?
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:34.180]   Let me figure out.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:38.140]   1 Corinthians 1310.
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:44.900]   My mind went blank.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.900]   When the perfect comes.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:46.900]   Okay.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.020]   When the perfect comes, the imperfect shall pass away.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:54.020]   The word perfect there is teleos and it's talking about something that God started that's
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.420]   bringing onto logical conclusion.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.300]   It may not be finished, but he's going to finish it.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.860]   That is not the word used here.
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.100]   Here it means to fill up something.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.100]   Right?
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.820]   So, everything that we need for salvation has been made complete.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.140]   We've been filled with him.
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.140]   Okay?
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.420]   Because he is fullness, is full deity, he is...
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.900]   There's no authority above him.
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:21.300]   He's able to make us full and complete.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:26.060]   He says, "You are also circumcised and circumcision made without hands."
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.060]   Right?
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.220]   So, remember we talked about in Colossians, there's two separate groups of people that
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.260]   he was concerned about.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.980]   He had the Gnostics for the Gentiles.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.900]   And where is Colossians?
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.380]   Remember?
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.660]   Geographically?
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.940]   Asia Minor.
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:48.180]   In Asia Minor, you have the seven churches, but there's also another church that's very
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.780]   prominent in the New Testament.
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.700]   Galatians are in that area.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:54.700]   Remember?
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.100]   Paul is writing to the Galatians because the Judaizers were having a huge impact in that
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.100]   area.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.100]   Right?
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.420]   So, he's dealing with both.
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.420]   So, in one side he's dealing with the Gnostics, and then the other side he's dealing with
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.420]   the Judaizers.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.580]   And so, he mentioned circumcision.
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:13.620]   Circumcision to the Jews, what did it mean for them?
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.060]   It was their covenant symbol.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.060]   Right?
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.180]   So, you couldn't be a child of God.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.340]   You couldn't say you were a Jew unless you were circumcised.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.820]   So, even if you were a foreigner who wanted to participate and be a part of the Jewish
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.580]   community, first thing they had to do was to be circumcised.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.700]   Right?
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.700]   Even their servants, even foreigners who came in who wanted to participate in society, they
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.100]   had to be circumcised.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:39.540]   But he says, so circumcision was their symbol that they belonged to God.
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:44.460]   But he says, you were also circumcised with circumcision made without hands.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.980]   In other words, Judaizers were probably telling the church, unless you get circumcised, you
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.940]   can't be a child of God.
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.420]   And that's why he writes the Book of Galatians.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:54.420]   Right?
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.180]   And so, they were probably being affected by the same group.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:02.940]   And he says, to this Gentile church, you were circumcised, but not the kind of circumcised
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:03.940]   that they got.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.420]   You got circumcised with circumcision without hands.
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.500]   Okay?
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:14.180]   And then, that's where he says, in the removal of the body of flesh by the circumcision of
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.180]   Christ.
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.580]   In other words, this is a spiritual circumcision.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:18.580]   Right?
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.220]   And then he goes into explain how this happened.
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.500]   Having been buried with him in baptism.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.460]   Let me stop right here.
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.460]   Okay?
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.460]   Within the next month or two, I'm probably going to revisit this issue of baptism.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.220]   Some of you were here when I gave the sermon on baptism and why we don't baptize infants
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.420]   here, why we're a Baptist church.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.700]   And I want our whole church to understand why we're Baptists.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.380]   It's not just my doctrine or doctrine of the leadership.
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:51.060]   We want you to be able to see from scripture why we don't baptize infants.
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.740]   The meaning behind baptism.
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.980]   People who baptize infants.
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.020]   I was baptized infant.
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.420]   My father was a Presbyterian.
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.980]   So this is not to say like, oh, they don't know their Bible or, you know, they're bad
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:03.980]   people.
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:10.580]   It's just, biblically, I could not see what I was taught from the Bible.
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.060]   This is their go-to text.
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:17.100]   If you came from a Presbyterian church and you were baptized as an infant and you were
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:23.660]   told that, and you studied through and this is why we baptize infants, this is the go-to
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.660]   text.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.980]   And the way that this is interpreted, and again, I'm not going to go too deep into this
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.780]   because that's not my goal today.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:35.380]   Having been buried with him in baptism, in which you are also raised up with him through
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:40.740]   the faith in the working of the dead, who raised you from the dead, right?
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:48.220]   So he connects, they connect the circumcision without hands and then he jumps to how did
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.460]   this happen?
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.080]   By being buried with him in baptism.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:57.900]   So people who baptize infants will say baptism is a replacement of circumcision in the new
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.160]   covenant.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.140]   Have you ever heard that before?
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.700]   Okay.
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:04.700]   Maybe not.
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.700]   Okay.
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.260]   Like I said, I'm not going to go too deep into this because I'm going to give a teaching
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.900]   on this at some point within a month or two.
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.760]   So based upon this text, and this is their go-to text, there is no other clearer text
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.380]   than this for them.
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:25.140]   That circumcision without hands is baptism.
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:32.880]   Now the reason why that interpretation doesn't make any sense is because circumcision without
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:38.540]   hands is unseen and it doesn't make sense to replace the physical circumcision with
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.100]   a physical baptism.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:44.000]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.160]   So baptism can't be a replacement because he said it is unseen.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:25:09.720]   So what is the unseen circumcision that Jesus is talking about?
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.400]   I'm hearing you but I'm not hearing you.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.840]   Okay.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:21.720]   It's hard to capture with one word but Jesus is referring to regeneration.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:29.100]   He says in the prophecies that he was going to place the law where?
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.720]   In our hearts.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:38.540]   How did he write his law in our hearts?
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.580]   By the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:46.580]   So the Holy Spirit is a symbol of the covenant in the New Testament.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:51.380]   It doesn't make sense that he would replace the physical circumcision with a physical
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:58.320]   baptism and then to sprinkle a baby who has no idea what's going on and say now you've
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.320]   entered into this covenant relationship.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.120]   The reason why that happened in the Old Testament was because the Old Testament, the covenant
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.280]   people were a nation.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.640]   And so being circumcised was a mark that you belonged to that nation.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.800]   In the New Testament the kingdom is a spiritual kingdom.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.440]   And so it is a spiritual symbol.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.520]   It is an unseen symbol.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.760]   So it is the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:29.600]   So when we get baptized all we're doing is symbolizing what is taking place spiritually.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.680]   In the baptism we are buried with Christ, we are raised with him but the real symbol
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.720]   is the Holy Spirit that is unseen.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.720]   Right?
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.720]   Okay.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.000]   Now that's, I'm just going to leave it at that for now.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.480]   I'm going to go into a little bit more detail later on, like when I give a sermon on that.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.680]   I just wanted to highlight this because we just happened to be in this text and this
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.440]   is an important text.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:56.560]   When you are dead in your transgressions, so there's about four or five things he mentions
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.560]   here.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.560]   Right?
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:05.320]   When you are dead in your transgressions and uncircumcision of your flesh he made you alive.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:11.360]   What does this passage remind you of?
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.360]   Romans 5.8.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.360]   Right?
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.040]   God demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.280]   In other words, Paul is saying you were dead.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.080]   You didn't add to this.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.080]   Right?
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:29.600]   He didn't say that he made you alive because you responded and he saw who was going to
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.040]   respond and based upon those who took their first step he chose you.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.040]   He said no.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.520]   It was when you were dead in your transgressions.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:43.200]   In other words, you played no part in this.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.540]   The reason why you were able to respond is because he was regenerating you.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:51.680]   The reason why there was faith in you is because he was already calling you.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.960]   He already elected you.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.840]   He already chose you.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.840]   Right?
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.040]   So the initiation, he didn't just throw out a net and saw who was going to respond.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:07.800]   He said you responded because he acted when you were dead in your transgression.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.280]   Right?
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.880]   Having been forgiven of our transgressions.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.880]   Because he initiated.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.040]   There's no part of it.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:21.960]   If you look at this whole salvation point, there's no part in here other than us responding
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.340]   in faith.
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.520]   And the reason why you have faith is because God put that there.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.120]   Having forgiven us through our transgression and having canceled out the certificate of
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.480]   death.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.960]   The word certificate here basically means something written.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.000]   Right?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.080]   So this can be a some people will look at that and say talking about accounting.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.120]   Right?
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:47.960]   Where you're like there's an accounting ledger of all your sins or it could be a legal document
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:54.000]   where legally you're declared a sinner and basically this consisting decree against us.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.140]   Right?
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:29:01.380]   So basically legally, legal standing before God whether it is accounting or whether it
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.660]   is a legal document, we stood condemned in the court of law.
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.660]   Right?
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.920]   In the heavenly court.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.320]   And God sits on the throne and he sees if we're guilty and said every single one was
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:19.660]   guilty and according to this ledger, this was hostile toward us.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:27.060]   But he has taken it away having nailed it on the cross.
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.540]   He completely made us new.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:33.900]   If you look at it here in verse 14, he says he has been he's forgiven us, he canceled
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:39.500]   our debt, he has taken it out, and he has nailed it to the cross.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.700]   Right?
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:50.500]   All of these things are different descriptions of what he did on the cross.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.860]   When he had disarmed the rulers and authorities.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:54.860]   Right?
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.900]   So who are the rulers and authorities that he's talking about?
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.780]   You can look at it in two ways.
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:06.700]   There is a physical and spiritual.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:11.860]   Who are the physical authorities?
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:19.260]   Romans, and then if you were a Jew, Pharisees.
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.260]   Right?
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.700]   Leaders of Israel.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.100]   And those two institutions were persecuting.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.100]   Right?
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:34.340]   And so if you happen to be a Jew, right, your whole history ever since the Assyrians have
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.300]   been oppressing you.
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:40.380]   And so in their mind they're waiting for the Messiah to come with authority to deliver
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.620]   them.
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.940]   Right?
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.540]   And that's why they crucified Christ.
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:50.380]   Because when they realized that Jesus wasn't going to overthrow the Romans, they got disappointed
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.140]   and said that's not the Messiah we want.
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.140]   Right?
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:58.700]   I mean he has all the qualities of a Messiah, but the most important quality of delivering
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:04.220]   us from our enemies, and when he submitted himself to them and gave his life, he said
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:05.260]   that's not it.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.620]   He's not what we want.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.620]   Right?
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:12.740]   So when he talks about the authority, he says you're waiting for authority to come and deliver
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:17.540]   you, he said Jesus has overcome the authorities.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:25.780]   Because the authority that he's overcoming, right, which I'll explain in a little bit.
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:30.540]   So in a physical sense he's overcome, he's triumphed over them because he didn't knock
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:35.340]   them out of power, but Christianity is spreading like wildfire.
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:43.100]   And it didn't happen the day he was crucified, but in 250 years Rome becomes a Christian
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.100]   nation.
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.740]   Right?
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.120]   Rome is completely converted to Christianity.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.300]   It becomes the base of the gospel, eventually.
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:58.100]   And then the Judaizers, I mean the Jews basically get conquered by the Romans, they get destroyed,
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.860]   and then Christianity basically takes over that area.
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:07.460]   So physically, the principalities, those who are in authority, they're overthrown.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.740]   But obviously there's a deeper meaning than that.
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.420]   There's a spiritual battle going on.
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:19.220]   Those who had authority over them, the demonic powers, they're also triumphed and displayed.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.620]   And they no longer have authority over us because he delivers us.
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:27.060]   He made public display of them, having triumphed over them through him.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.580]   One of the questions that came up was the word "through him."
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:34.940]   Can somebody with the NIV read that part again?
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:40.340]   Okay, so in the NIV it says "by the cross."
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.340]   Okay?
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:47.020]   NIV has gone a step further because that's not what the Greek text says.
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:51.480]   The Greek text is "altos," which basically means "himself."
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.060]   So the NASB just left it alone.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.460]   Or another way to translate it is "not himself, but itself."
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:03.380]   So NIV has gone the extra step and said, "Oh, this means the cross."
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.580]   So it could mean the cross.
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:12.420]   But the meaning behind that is not crystal clear, but most likely it's referring to the
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.300]   cross.
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.260]   Most likely it's referring to the cross, the way he did it, because that's what he says
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.460]   previously.
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:24.580]   And all of this ultimately pointing to what Christ has done.
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:29.300]   Okay, like I said, there's so much in this text, and it's hard for me to just kind of
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:34.660]   linger on any one particular point, but every single one of these things are so rich.
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:40.260]   And you'll see that everything that he says in every verse, Paul expands it, expounds
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:44.580]   on it in much more detail in some other part of Scripture.
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:49.300]   You could probably find at least a chapter on each one of these lines in the Book of
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.300]   Romans.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:55.220]   Okay, so I'm going to leave it to you to take some time to discuss with your group, but
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:01.860]   the significance behind all of this is, again, that we've been delivered, that our sins have
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:07.460]   been forgiven, and if we didn't earn our salvation, you can't lose your salvation.
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:14.140]   But all of this based upon if you have genuine faith.
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:20.780]   It doesn't require faith to come to church, right?
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.980]   Non-Christians can come to church.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.780]   It doesn't require faith to be generous.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.840]   Non-Christians are generous too.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.980]   It doesn't require faith to be kind.
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.580]   There's plenty of non-Christians who are kind.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:40.460]   It doesn't require faith to be disciplined.
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.180]   Plenty of people are disciplined.
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:49.220]   It doesn't require faith to study the Bible, right?
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.860]   It doesn't.
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:54.700]   It doesn't require faith to be a Bible scholar.
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:59.760]   You can do all of that without faith.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:04.920]   But true hope in Christ can only be had by faith.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:11.180]   True hope, not wishful thinking.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:17.340]   But true hope, true hope that changes our perspective on everything, that causes us
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.540]   to live for eternal values.
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:27.100]   Only a person who genuinely believes that will pursue that.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:31.660]   So people without faith can pursue church, be kind, study the Bible, maybe even teach
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:36.660]   the Bible, even lead small group without faith.
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:43.340]   But only those who have genuine faith are their sins truly forgiven.
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.660]   And those whose sins are forgiven have hope in Christ.
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.740]   Now, none of this is new.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.380]   You've heard this many, many times.
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:58.540]   But at the core of our connection to God is faith.
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:35:59.660]   All this was given to us.
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:06.940]   So superficially, if you don't have faith, you may look at that and say, "Great!
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:07.940]   Salvation is free.
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:08.940]   Jesus is awesome.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.500]   I love the people at church.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.420]   Why not?"
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.060]   And you can do all that without faith.
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:25.340]   But only because it is a gift of God and everything hinges upon this faith.
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:32.460]   Because everything that he's talking about here, deliverance, forgiveness of sins, all
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:37.980]   authority under his power, hope in Christ, all of that was just given to us.
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.660]   It was just given to us freely.
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:47.760]   But there's only one thing that causes us, there's only one door that causes us to tap
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.220]   into all of that.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.920]   It's faith.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:57.380]   So if this faith, that's why Jesus said, "If you have a faith of a mustard seed, you could
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.180]   move mountains."
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:04.380]   Because it's this faith that connects us to this God.
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:09.380]   So the power is not in this faith, but the faith is the door that gets us to God.
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:17.620]   So if we don't have genuine faith, you can pretend.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:18.740]   You can do Bible study.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.860]   You can work hard.
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:23.040]   You can have fellowship in the church.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.040]   You can be generous.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.040]   You can be kind.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.460]   You can do all of that.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:33.020]   But everything that Jesus is talking about here and having hope in Christ and being delivered
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:38.820]   from this bondage of sin, all of that is this faith.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:46.460]   So how important is it that we have absolute assurance that we have this faith?
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.360]   I mean, it's crucial.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:55.340]   And I think that's where sometimes we miss the point in discipleship, in church, evangelism,
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:06.620]   and all of these things, because we've become good at doing church with very little faith
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.260]   to no faith.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:15.080]   So as great as all of this is, the fundamental question that we have to ask ourselves is,
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.580]   do I have this faith that connects me to all this?
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:26.900]   So the first question in our discussion, or at least the second question, let me start
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:27.900]   with this.
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:28.900]   No.
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.580]   Actually, let me just go through the questions.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:36.580]   Can someone who has no evidence of circumcision of the heart claim assurance of salvation?
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:41.500]   Why or why not?
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.740]   That's pretty clear, right?
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:47.200]   What do you think is the practical amplification of salvation by faith versus salvation by
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:51.340]   works for those who truly believe?
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:57.380]   We can automatically think, well, if you give salvation by faith and not by works, isn't
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.300]   that going to lead to lawlessness?
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.700]   I mean, it's given to you.
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.700]   I mean, you can't, you didn't earn your salvation, so you can't lose your salvation.
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.820]   So I can do whatever I want.
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.740]   I may feel guilty about it, but it doesn't affect my salvation.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:16.140]   Can that cause licentiousness in the church?
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:20.860]   Does it?
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:21.860]   So that's my question.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:26.340]   And I'm going to give you the answer so you don't go off tangent and spend 30 minutes
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.740]   in wrong doctrine.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:35.740]   It does not if you really believe.
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:44.540]   Yes.
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:53.980]   Because that's what, that's what is recited in the New Testament.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.100]   Right.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:01.620]   So there's a difference between having no faith and having little faith.
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:05.820]   So disciples were constantly rebuked for having little faith.
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:11.580]   And so that little faith is what caused them, even in fear and they're running and denying
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:17.540]   Jesus, when all of those people, again, John 6, 66, when people turned away because they
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:20.860]   couldn't handle what Jesus was saying, Jesus turns around and says, "Are you going to leave
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:21.860]   to the disciples?
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:22.940]   Where are we going to go?
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.760]   We don't understand you, but you have the words of truth."
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:31.660]   And so that little faith is what caused them to continue in their faith.
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:35.380]   So when we say, "I believe, help my unbelief," meaning I want greater faith.
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.620]   I do believe, but I want greater faith.
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:44.300]   But that's a distinction between somebody who doesn't believe at all.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:51.860]   Oh, so the question was, if faith is what causes us to be connected to this great God
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:57.140]   that we see here, like why do we pray, "I believe, but help my unbelief."
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:00.500]   Like, you know, it's like, "I don't believe, but help me to believe."
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.500]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.500]   So that was the question.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.940]   So I think that's a very good question, right?
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:11.180]   Because it does make a, there is a distinction between having little faith versus having
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:14.020]   no faith.
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:19.180]   Third, in what way was the record of your sins hostile towards you?
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.300]   In what way have you been delivered from this hostility?
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.980]   What is the, obviously the evidence is the Holy Spirit, but what is the evidence of the
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.860]   Holy Spirit tangibly in our life?
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:29.860]   Okay?
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:38.540]   Let me pray for us, and then I'll let you guys have time in your small group.
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:43.940]   Heavenly Father, we ask for your blessing over our time, and I pray for our small groups,
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:48.100]   Lord God, now that you would help us to be open and honest, help us to wrestle with the
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:54.340]   text that we've studied, and we ask, Lord God, that your word would bear deep roots
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:42:00.440]   in our lives, in our hearts, and help us to grow in appreciation of what you have done.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:05.380]   And all that is written here, Lord God, will not simply add more knowledge to our minds,
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:10.420]   but it would renew our hearts, Lord God, to know this is what you've done for us.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:13.700]   You've delivered us while we were dead in our trespasses.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.500]   You've canceled our debt.
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:21.220]   I pray, Father, that all of this would cause us to give our lives as a living sacrifice,
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.580]   which is a reasonable response that you ask.
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.340]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
