[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Sing all that I am.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   All that I am, all that I have, I lay them down before you.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Oh Lord, all my regrets, all my acclaim, the joy and the pain, I'm making them yours.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Sing all that I am.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   All that I am, all that I have, I lay them down before you.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Oh Lord, all my regrets, all my acclaim, the joy and the pain, I'm making them yours.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Lord, I offer my life to you.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Everything I put through, use it for your glory.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Lord, I offer my days to you.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Lifting my praise to you as a pleasing sacrifice.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Lord, I offer you my life.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Things in the past, things yet unseen, wishes and dreams that are yet to come true.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   All of my goals, all of my plans, my heart and my hands are lifted to you.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Lord, I offer my life to you.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Everything I put through, use it for your glory.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Lord, I offer my days to you.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Lifting my praise to you as a pleasing sacrifice.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Lord, I offer you my life.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Lord, I offer my life to you.

[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Lord, I offer my days to you.

[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Lord, I offer you my life.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   We have four announcements here.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   The first one is for this Wednesday.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   We're going to be having a gospel presentation where Pastor Mark will be presenting on Heaven and Hell.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And afterwards, there'll be a panel Q&A with David Mobley and Elder James.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   If you have any questions about that, please contact Pastor Mark and he'll give you more instructions.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Secondly, a Jubilee Picnic Fellowship is going to be on July 14th.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   That is for anybody that is 50 years and older.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And it's going to be $10 a person.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Elder Phillips should be tabling after each of these services.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So if you could go out there and sign up for that, that would be very helpful.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Third, Berean Family Ministry Beach Day is going to be on a Saturday on the 20th of July.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And it's going to be from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Bolsa Chica State Beach.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Please RSVP for that so that we can get a headcount.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And lastly, Family Ministry Summer Retreat is 95% filled.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Next Sunday is the last day to sign up, so please sign up immediately so that you can reserve a spot.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Well, today we have a little bit of a packed service.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   After our praise time, we'll be having our brother Elijah baptized today.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And after that, we'll be having a video play about the Korea team that just came back, as well as a testimony.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And so if you could just ready your hearts for all of that, that would be good.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Let me pray for the offering this morning.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you, and we pray, God, that you would receive pleasing sacrifices to you.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Lord, with our voices, with our lives, and with our money.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Father, I pray that this would be because we desire your purposes and your goals.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   So thank you, Lord, for all that you give us.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.

[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Today, we'll be introducing a hymn.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It is called, "Oh, For a Thousand Tongues to Sing."
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And I'd like to read just a few verses from it.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing, my great Redeemer's praise.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   The glories of my God and King, the triumphs of his grace.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   He breaks the power of canceled sin.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   He sets the prisoner free.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   His blood can make the foulest clean, his blood availed for me.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   He speaks, and listening to his voice, new life the dead receive.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   The mournful broken hearts rejoice, the humble poor believe.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Amen to this gospel.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   So let's sing this hymn together.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing, my great Redeemer's praise.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   The glories of my God and King, the triumphs of his grace.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing, my great Redeemer's praise.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   The glories of my God and King, the triumphs of his grace.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   My gracious master and my God, assist me to proclaim,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   to spread through all the earth abroad the wonders of thy name.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Jesus, the name that charms our fears, that bids our sorrows cease.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   'Tis music in the sinner's ears, 'tis life and health and peace.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   He breaks the power of canceled sin, he sets the prisoner free.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   His blood can make the foulest flee, his blood availed for me.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   He speaks.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   He speaks, and listening to his voice, new life the dead receive.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   The mournful broken hearts rejoice, the humble poor believe.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Glory to God and praise and love be ever, ever give.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   By saints below and saints above, the church in earth and heaven.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Oh, for a thousand.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing, my great Redeemer's praise.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   The glories of my God and King, the triumphs of his grace.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Amen.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   From the brightness-- from the brightness of his glory,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Jesus, the Son of God, descends.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Takes on the nature of a servant, Jesus, obedient to death.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   A father willed to crush him as a sacrifice for sin.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   He satisfied God's justice, and in victory rose again.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   You are highly exalted, name above all names,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   worthy of all praise.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   You are reigning in glory, Jesus,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   you're the King over everything.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Exalted to the highest place, given
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   the name above all other names.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   The tomb is empty.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   The tomb is empty.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Christ is risen, Jesus, the Lamb was crucified.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   The angels never cease to worship Jesus in heaven glorified.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   To him belongs the power, the wisdom, might, and strength.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   All glory and dominion to the Lord of every age.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   You are highly exalted, name above all names,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   worthy of all praise.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   You are reigning in glory, Jesus,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   you're the King over everything.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Exalted to the highest place, given
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   the name above all other names.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Our knees will bow, our tongues proclaim
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   that you are Lord of all.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Our knees will bow, our tongues proclaim
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   that you are Lord of all.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Our knees will bow, our tongues proclaim
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   that you are Lord of all.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Our knees will bow, our tongues proclaim
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   that you are Lord of all.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   You are highly exalted, name above all names,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   worthy of all praise.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   You are reigning in glory, Jesus,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   you're the King over everything.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Exalted to the highest place, given
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   the name above all other names.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Amen, you may be seated.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Good morning, Berean Ministry, friends and family.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   My name is Elijah Hom, and I am currently
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   attending UCI, nearing the end of this journey.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Like many, I grew up in the church.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   I've been exposed, taught, and experienced
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   God's word many times.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   It took me a while to realize,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   but I had just been blindly listening.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   I had falsely believed I was saved,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   and his word never really took place in my heart.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   I had the mindset of just doing what I was told.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   There was never any growth, and it was more
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   of a cover to make myself look better
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   in everyone else's eyes.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Eventually, as I got older, I got more
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   and more defiant, more confident in being
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   able to say no to going to events.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   I'd come to believe the self-idolization
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   of not wanting to attend any church events
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   or doing anything at all, because I simply
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   didn't want to.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   I had no desire to grow in God.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Transferring to UCI last year and being
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   on my own, I believe it really put me
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   in a position where I had to acknowledge
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   that what I had been doing previously
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   was just me being selfish, ignorant,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   and avoiding the truth that I was not saved.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   I can't say that there was a specific moment
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   that I received Christ, but that it was
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   a gradual growth, understanding acceptance
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   throughout the past two years.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   I had come to realize my own sin and how
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   I was serving only myself.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   I only went to events that I deemed was
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   more fun for me.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I had succumbed to my own laziness
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   and essentially spat at God.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   I was living for myself and only doing
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   things that I wanted to do.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Luckily, I was given many opportunities
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   from God, in which my sin was presented
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   more adamantly to me.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   There are many teachings that would feel
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   like an attack to me because deep down,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   I knew it was true for me.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   I didn't want to accept it, but God
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   was persistent, and I had no choice but
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   to acknowledge my sins.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   I was but a mere fake, only keeping up
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   a physical appearance with a wicked heart to God.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   I simply had no desire to love God,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   to follow Him, or to devote myself to Him.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Gradually, I accepted that I was in fact
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   not saved, and I needed to accept God
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   and have Christ grow in me.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   I had to acknowledge that I was afraid,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   afraid of not being accepted,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   afraid of being mistaken and wrong.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   It took me some time, but I finally came
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   to accept that I needed to trust in Him
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   and burn into my mind and heart that
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   God loves me and wants to save me from my sins.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   I needed to fully give my all to Him
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   and not put up a false act.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   I had to stop thinking of what I would
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   want and live for Him.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   I am still growing in Christ, and I know
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   now that I do have a desire to love God,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   and I know that I want to continuously
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   strengthen my faith in Him and spread His Word.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   I believe that God sacrifices only
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   His Son for our sins.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   I believe that we must repent to be saved.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   I believe that God knows all and has
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   everything according to His plan,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   and I believe that I must work to cast
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   away my sinful life and grow in this
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   new body provided by the Lord.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   As I cast out my old life, I declare
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   my love, trust, and devotion to Christ,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   and I hope to also be held accountable
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   to everyone that witnessed.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Thank you.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   [Applause]
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   [Pause]
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   [Pause]
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   [Applause]
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   [Pause]
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Dear passengers, welcome to Seoul.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   For your safety, please remain seated
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   with your seat belt fastened until the
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   sign is turned on.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   [Beep]
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   [Pause]

[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   [Pause]
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   [Pause]
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   [Pause]
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   [Pause]
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   [Pause]
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   [Pause]
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   [Pause]
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   [Pause]
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   [Pause]
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   [Pause]
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   [Pause]
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   [Pause]
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   [Pause]
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   [Pause]
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   [Pause]
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   [Pause]
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Good morning, church family.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   My name is Woojin Chong,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   and I'm one of the 19 members
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   that had the privilege of being part
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   of the Korea Summer Mission team.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   We traveled to Korea for two and a half weeks,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   primarily hosting an English retreat
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   with Namu Church and running an English camp
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   with Pastor Noh from Sarang Dongsan Church.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Coming into the trip, I had mixed emotions
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   about doing mission work in Korea.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   I had been praying for and looking forward
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   to going out to Korea prior to COVID
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   when I last went on a vision trip
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   to Japan with Rian in 2019.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Through that trip, my desire to want
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   to do mission work in Korea has been
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   steadily growing over the years,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   with a bumpy road along the way
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   as various life circumstances over the years
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   prevented me from going.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   As the date to Korea got closer and closer
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   in the last few months,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   I started feeling anxious as well.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Would I be able to say that I was in a place
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   in my life where I was being faithful
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   in my witness as a Christian?
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Would I be useful and effective to the team,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   or would I be a hindrance in the work?
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Lots of unknowns of the trip brought about
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   nervousness and anxiousness,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   but I continued to pray that whatever the outcome,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   I would do my best to stay faithful
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   to the Kingdom work whenever we went.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   With this mixed emotion, I went to Korea,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   and from the moment that we landed,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   I can say now with full confidence
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   that as I look back, God was faithful
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   in stirring up a heart for the country
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   and the people, not just inside my heart,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   but as well as the rest of our team members,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   as we got to interact with various people
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   throughout the trip.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   From the beginning of the trip,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   I was unexpectedly pulled into translating
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   and interpreting from English to Korean
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   and vice versa,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   as there were some difficulties
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   with language barrier,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   especially with the younger audiences
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   like the children when we visited
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Jinmyung Care Center in Incheon.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Because I was not fully confident
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   in my ability to effectively communicate
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   for the team in real time,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   I was a little hesitant to do so,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   but despite the limited experience,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   God was able to graciously use it
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   to bridge the gap between the Korean
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   and the English that was present
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   throughout the trip.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   I got to see how God used my circumstances
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   of being both fluent in Korean and English
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   as a way to be a support to the team.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   It was truly a humbling experience
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   as I got to learn how to better communicate
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   not only in common and casual conversations,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   but also translating intentional conversations
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   back and forth
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   during my small group discussion times
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   at the English retreat,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   because my small group was divided
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   between Korean-only speakers and English-only speakers.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   This was one of the times in the trip
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   where I vividly remember
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   some of the most thought-provoking
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   and intentional conversations that came up
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   with the different attendees in there.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   With one attendee who only spoke English,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   I would encourage and challenge
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   a struggling, professing believer in their walk
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   and pointed them back to the gospel,
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   while with another attendee who spoke only Korean,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   I would challenge them to think through
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   the spiritual realities presented in the Bible
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   and to show them that a life lived for the world
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   and for self-pleasure and sin
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   was ultimately in vain,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   and that true life and purpose
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   could only be found in Christ alone.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   And then I would have to wrestle through
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   how to translate this back and forth.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   The opportunity to be able to
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   share the gospel in both languages
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   was truly an insightful
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   and memorable experience
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   throughout the retreat as this went on
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   in multiple small group sessions.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   I also had the privilege
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   of being able to share my testimony
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   fully in Korean for Namu Church,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   which in of itself was a challenge
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   trying to write it out in Korean,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   but thankfully God used it
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   to encourage the believers at the church.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   In a strange way,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   I felt out of place
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   and yet at the same time
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   comfortably home.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   I was legally by citizenship
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   an American, and yet at the same time
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   I was a Korean native
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   born and raised in Seoul
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   and had the privilege of
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   being able to experience
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   both sides at the same time.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   My heart kept wrestling
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   back and forth between the desire
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   to return back home to my family,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   my church, and to continue
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   the work that I was doing here,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   while at the same time there was a desire
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   in my heart to remain in Korea
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   and be God's worker
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   in the field where the harvest was truly
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   plentiful, but the faithful workers
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   were few.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   There is an urgent need of the gospel
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   in Korea, and we got
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   to witness the decline of Christianity
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   not just through hearing, but
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   with our very own eyes throughout the trip.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   As I continued
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   to wrestle with these thoughts,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   I continued to reflect on what it meant
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   for my own future trajectory.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   From a practical and worldly
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   perspective, I would
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   hope that in the next five
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   to ten years, I would start advancing
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   in my career, look to
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   start a family and settle down, maybe
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   buy a house down the line and so forth.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Without any major
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   changes going on, I would assume that
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   this was most likely the things that
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   I would be pursuing down the line.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   But it was in these pursuits
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   that I had to really wrestle
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   in my heart.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   If God called me to a different life
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   where I had
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   to give up these pursuits,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   would I be willing to sacrifice these
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   pursuits to go out and pursue
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   a life unto God's kingdom?
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Would I, like the prophet Isaiah,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   be able to confidently proclaim,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   "Lord, here am I.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Send me."
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   One of the passages that I got
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   to meditate on a lot during the trip was
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Acts 15-16.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   As I reflected on Paul's ministry,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   in which he was sent out by the church
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   with full confidence, and
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   in whatever direction God pulled him to,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   he was flexible and faithful
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   in preaching the gospel wherever he went.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   I desired the
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   same outcome for my own life,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   that whether I am sent or
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   I stay back home, to remain
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   faithful to God's calling for my life
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   and to be faithful to the preaching of the
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   gospel to those around me
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   that are lost and in need of the salvation.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Being sent
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   out does not mean a greater
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   godliness or greater faithfulness
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   to Christ compared to remaining at home.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Yet, if God
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   does call me at any point to anywhere,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   whether it is Korea or
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   a different location, that I would
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   be flexible and heed God's
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   calling with eagerness and with
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   excitement.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   It was such an encouraging two and a half
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   weeks, spending time with our
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   team members, many who were also
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   wrestling through similar thoughts on their
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   calling and future life trajectory.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   I think one of my favorite aspects of the trip
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   was getting to know some of our team members
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   better in a way that
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   could only really be experienced because
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   we were all united in our efforts
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   to bring witness in Korea.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Through many of the
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   conversations with our team members,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   I was encouraged to see how there were many
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   within the team who also shared
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   in the desire to be faithful to God's
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   calling in their lives, wherever they're called.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   And I
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   earnestly pray that this
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   experience would not be something that is only felt
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   by our team members,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   but with the rest of the church body as well.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   It was also encouraging
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   spending time with the faithful
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   workers in Korea who are all
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   passionate to share the gospel
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   locally and globally and seeing
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   their heart for God's mission work.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   The same God that works powerfully
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   here is the same
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   God that works powerfully
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   in Korea as well, through all
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   the individuals that are involved.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   I am confident that whatever plans
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   God has for Korea, that He
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   will continue to sustain and bring
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   about fruit in the labor and work
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   that are being done out there.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   I want to thank all of you
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   who have been fervently praying for
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   our team and for Korea these last few
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   weeks. I ask that
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   the church would continue to pray for Korea.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Pray that God would
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   open a clear door for
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   our church to be able to go
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   on a longer term and that we will be
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   able to bring the gospel to a nation
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   that is in desperate need of Jesus Christ.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   I also pray that
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   God would call His workers
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   and that they would heed His call for
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   mission and to go wherever God
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   sends them, whether locally
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   or globally, knowing that
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   it is written, "How beautiful
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   are the feet of those who bring good
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   things to the knees of good things."
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Thank you.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   [applause]
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   [applause]
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   [applause]
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   - All right. Well, thank you,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Eugene, and thank you for everyone
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   who's prayed for us.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   We're very thankful to be back
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   and continue the work here,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   and we are very much
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   kind of ignited, I think,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   as a team, and remembering
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   again what it is that we're trying to do here as well.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Would you turn with me to Romans 12:1?
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   And this is a
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   passage that I was thinking
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   about as I was over there.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Romans 12:1-2.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   "Therefore I urge you,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   bodies a living and holy sacrifice
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   acceptable to God, which is
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   your spiritual service of worship.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   And do not be conformed to this world, but be
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   transformed by the renewing of your mind,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   so that you may prove what the will of God is,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   that which is good and acceptable and perfect."
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Father,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   as we go into your Word, I pray that
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   you would impress it deep into our hearts,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Lord, that you would show us what it means,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   even a passage so often
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   visited,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   that we would respond
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   in obedience to your will and call.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Today,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   we're not going to be going through
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   every portion of this text, and yet,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   this is a very common
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   sermon that's given because
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   it's so rich, and there's so many
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   angles and so much
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   that can be pulled up out of a text
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   like this. But we are
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   going to be focusing very singularly on
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   this thought that kept coming into my mind,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   which is that growth
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   has a goal. And that's what
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   we're going to be looking at today. This is our
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   sermon title, that growth
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   has a goal. And so I want to invite you
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   to think about that.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   What would it be like to run without
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   a goal?
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Or to work without a goal? Make
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   money?
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   To go on a vacation without
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   a goal? If there is no goal,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   if there is no direction
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   to it, then what happens
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   to that action?
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   1 Corinthians
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   chapter 9 verse 24 says, "Do you not
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   know that those who run in a race run,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   but only one receives
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   the prize? Run in such a way that you
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   may win. Everyone who competes
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   in the games exercises self-control in all
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   things. They then do it to receive
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Therefore I run in such a way
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   as not without aim. I box
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   in such a way as not beating the air.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   But I discipline my body and make it my slave
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   so that after I have preached to others,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   I myself will not be disqualified."
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   So here in this
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   passage, even in discipline,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   even in self-control,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   it happens because there is
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   an end goal, that there
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   is a direction to our lives.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   If you were
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   to think about
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   any kind of movement
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   without a goal, then it's just
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   expended energy.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   If you were to shove someone across an ice
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   without direction,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   then it doesn't really have
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   any kind of end desire
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   or matter.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   At the end, there is no such thing
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   as having no goal.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   There is no such thing as having no direction.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   If we
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   think that we're doing something
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   and there is no goal or direction,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   then one will be supplied for us.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Because in our lives,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   the direction
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   and goal that tends to appear
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   is going to be
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   the things that we love,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   the things that we worship,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   and that there is going to be a purpose,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   whether we know it or not.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   For worshippers,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   regardless of whether
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   you're worshipping the one true God,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   or whether you're
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   worshipping something else,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   there is going to be a direction
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   and goal. So we have to be
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   careful here.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   In Romans chapter 1 through 11,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   it's been leading up to this passage,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   these chapters
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   that describe the gospel and all
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   the outworkings of the gospel.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   It's been talking about it for the individual,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   but also through the people of God, and how
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   he's working out his plans.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   In essence,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   there is a goal and direction
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   that God has been working towards.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   And so we're going to be looking
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   at two points,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   as it all funnels down to what he
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   desires for us.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   What our goals and what our desires
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   ought to be. And the first
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   is that our goal is not just sacrifice,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   but acceptable
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   sacrifice.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Not just
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   blindly giving whatever
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   it is that we think that God wants, but
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   it must be acceptable
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   in his sight.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   So if you look at verse 1 again, it says,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   "Therefore I urge you, brethren,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   by the mercies of God, to present
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   your bodies a living and holy sacrifice,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   acceptable to God, which is your
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   spiritual service of worship."
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   And so, a lot
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   of what we've been seeing in this book,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   up till chapter 12, is going to
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   be foundational.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   And so he uses this word "therefore"
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   at the beginning of chapter 12.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   Looking back to the entirety of
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   the gospel message of what God has been trying to accomplish,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   to this salvation that
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   has been given to you, and to me.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   This is
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   the origin point of movement. This is the
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   foundation, and the origin point,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   the foundation is different than goal
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   and direction.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   This is that call
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   not to forget
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   where you're from.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Don't forget what you've been given.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Don't forget that there's an
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   urging going on here because of this
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   foundation.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   It's an earnest request.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   This urging is a personal appeal
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   that he's giving.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   An urgency in how we're called
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   to live.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   This urgency is matching up to
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   all the foundation of what
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   is given in the gospel.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   God has shown us that the
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   word used here is by the mercies of God.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   He's shown us mercy.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   And so now from this truth,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   from this foundation,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   is given to us a
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   direction, or a goal.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   For us, we are all sinners.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   We're all unworthy.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   We have all received love.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   There's nothing
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   that we have that we have not been given.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   In the parable of the Good Samaritan,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   as believers, we do not
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   walk past the suffering person.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Why?
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Because God didn't walk past us.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   When we were in need, God stopped.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   In the parable of the
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   unforgiving servant,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   we don't withhold forgiveness because
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   God did not withhold
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   forgiveness from us when we pled
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   before him.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   And so we forgive because
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   we've been shown forgiveness.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   We show mercy because we've been shown mercy.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   We love because we've been shown love.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   And so our foundation, this is the therefore.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   You are to live in such a way
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   which provides
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   us the direction.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   So this is letter B, direction.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   This is towards the goal.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   This is also a call to remember in which
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   direction to go.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Christianity is not just a marching order that we're
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   called to just perform blindly.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   It's not just a checklist of
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   to-do things, of this
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   and that, and we move along
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   and forward in our lives just marching in a
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   mindless direction.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   If the foundation is the therefore of this
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   passage, that we've been given such a
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   great salvation, this movement towards
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   an end is going to be found in the rest of it.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Justification is a point.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   It's a point in time
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   in something that God has accomplished
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   for us.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   But that is not the place we simply revolve.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   It's an
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   origin point that constantly pushes
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   into this place
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   called sanctification.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   Direction
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   has a goal.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   If I were to use
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   a loose illustration here, since
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   many have kind of gone through our college ministry,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   sometimes in our college
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   retreats, or if you can think back at the
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   time, a long time ago when you were a college
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   student or something like that, there's a game
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   that we play. It's called cannons.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   What we would do is there would be one
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   student on the ground and he would blindfold
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   himself and there would be a student
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   behind him directing him on where to go.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   One of the common
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   snacks that we have at retreats are these
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Welch's fruit snacks.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   We would just dump the entire box all over the ground
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   and the point of this game would be
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   for the person who's blindfolded to grab
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   one of these fruit snacks and launch it
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   and hit another team.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   They would go out. That was the whole point of the game.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Inevitably,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   as you were watching this, you would begin
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   to see, wow,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   there's a pattern as to who
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   wins and who loses.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   The ones who win or the ones
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   who lost, it's because they would either
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   follow directions or not.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   There were
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   students who just were so
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   enthusiastic.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Perhaps they felt the eyes of all those
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   that they were trying to impress.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   They would grab one of these things and without
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   heeding the directions of those behind them,
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   would grab it and just throw it in any
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   which direction, which in the beginning
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   they might get some people out,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   but towards the end, that wouldn't work.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   I saw another thing, which is that the person
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   who was standing behind would give directions
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   as to where to throw.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   They would say, "Pick it up."
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   They would not know how to pick it up.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   They would say, "Oh, it's a little bit to the left."
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Then they would swing too far left.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   They'd grab it and say, "Fire!"
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   They would just throw it up in the air.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   They would have to listen to these directions.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Inevitably, in panic,
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   there's always someone who just grabs and fires.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   There are going to be
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   those who actually listen to the directions.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Those were the ones
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   who won the game.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   When we think about our lives,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   if you were to think about
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   the direction of your life,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   if you were to think about God
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   providing direction,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   if there is a goal
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   in all the things
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   that we are trying to do in our decisions,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   in the pursuits,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   are we just grabbing and firing?
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   Is it just in a certain direction?
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   Or are we listening to our God?
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   What is the goal?
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   What is the purpose?
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   I believe that many times this is what we're doing.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   We're just firing away.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   In 1 Corinthians 9,
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   he says, "Do not box
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   as if you're just beating the air."
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   I believe it's very, very
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   easy for us to go down this path
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   as believers from a foundation point
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   that we have been saved,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   we have been given such a great salvation,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   and then our decisions, and our will,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   and our actions, and the things
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   that we desire to accomplish in our lives,
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   we're just firing away.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Titus 2, verse 11
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   shows us that there's direction.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   "For the grace of God has appeared,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   bringing salvation to all men,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   instructing us to deny ungodliness
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   and worldly desires, and to live sensibly,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   righteously, and godly in the present age."
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   It's an instruction set upon the believer
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   to live denying the ungodly
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   and worldly desires that come.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   To live in a way
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   that makes sense to the believer that there is
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   an end to our righteous and godly,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   even in the present age.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   We don't get to just do
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   whatever we want now because we have been
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   given salvation.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   We have been created for good works.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   We are made holy for a purpose.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Our lives belong
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   to God.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   Our desires have been
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   changed. We don't want our will
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   any longer, but God's.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   We don't invite God into my plans.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   Our desires
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   are for His plans.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   We know that God has direction for my life.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   We know that He has direction for our church.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   And we know that God has a direction for this
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   world.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   Of course we believe that.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   We believe that He desires His goals
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   to a redeemed world, a redeemed humanity
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   that will glorify Him.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Are we just firing away
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   wherever we want?
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   Are we just generally saying,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   "Yes, I believe that."
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   But our decisions to which university
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   to attend, to what major
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   to go, to careers,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   to relationships,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   to what we purchase, the use
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   of our money, our free time, expenditure
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   of our energy and resources
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   has become directionless,
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   mindless.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   His purposes,
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   His magnification, His glory.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   We say that with one part
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   of our mouth, and out of
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   that same mouth,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   just use it
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   however we want.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   See, God doesn't accept
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   all sacrifices.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   Not all
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   sacrifices are true worship.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   Sacrifice
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   has a direction.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   True worship
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   has a direction
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   to His ends,
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   His desires,
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   to His plans.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   In this passage, when He says
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   to present your bodies a living and holy
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   sacrifice acceptable to God,
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   He uses this idea of presenting
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   your body.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   Another way to understand this word
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   is to make available your body.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   There is potential
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   for us to do quite the opposite.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   To make our bodies
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   unavailable to His purposes.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   To make our time,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   our energy, our money,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   our resources, unavailable to God.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   Why?
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Because the direction
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   that we're going towards is our goals.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   Our checkbooks
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   betray us, don't they?
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   Where we spend our leisure time, it betrays
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   us sometimes, doesn't it?
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   The things that we think about over and over
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   again, what dominates
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   our attention many times,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   is it God's
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   direction?
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   To fulfill our own desires,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   our own ends,
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   our own purpose. Sometimes I think we can feel it.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   Sometimes we can feel
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   it in our church.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Are we just running programs
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   at church?
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Are we just
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   studying the scriptures?
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Are we just running
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   things mindlessly?
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   Are we too easily satisfied in our efforts
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   without it actually
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   accomplishing anything?
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   Are we running around, chasing
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   our own tails, thinking
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   that we're living a Christian life that honors
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   God with no rubric as to gauge
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   whether we're truly honoring God
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   or not? Are we saying
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   we're worshiping God and yet it is not
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   bringing God worship? Are we saying that we
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   desire to do His will, His purposes,
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   His goals, and yet the decisions that we're
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   making in our lives have nothing to do with Him?
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   If we read
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   the text plainly, we are sacrifices.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   Another way
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   to think about this is that we're dead.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   Our own personal
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   desires are dead. Our own personal aspirations
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   are dead. Our own personal checklists
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   and to-dos are dead.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   That is why the sanctification is described
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   as a process of death. This idea of
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   living sacrifice is
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   sanctification. To
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   lose our lives in order that we might live.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   It's found in Scripture,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   this understanding of the believer
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   in this day and age.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   Lose self to follow
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   Christ. Lose your life in order to
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   live. Follow Him
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   into suffering and death, not
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   only at the moment of salvation but as a course
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   and direction of our lives until the
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   moment we die.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   Of course,
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   this is not to say that we're not allowed to have our own
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   desires. I'm not saying we're called to
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   micromanage ourselves and wonder and
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   police ourselves and check every single little
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   thing that we do, but we know
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   if we're to back up and look at the trajectory
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   of our lives, what direction we've
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   been going. You know it and I know it.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   And we can say
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   permissible and beneficial all we want. We
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   know
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   that we're given away in the
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   choices that we make.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   In the places where we expend our resources.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   This idea of sacrifice was
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   that it's meant to be consecrated.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   That we're
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   meant to be set apart for His purposes.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   For His glory.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   He's
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   the center. It's not, we get
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   to live our lives and we try to pull Him
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   into ours.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   And our prayers then betray us.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   Because the things that we
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   pray show whether we want His goals or my
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   goals.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   If you look at, if you read through the Pentateuch,
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   the seriousness of God's holiness
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   shines.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   God is meticulous in His instructions
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   to worship and sacrifice because each
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   part actually matters. I think what we
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   do is we try to wipe it all away because we say
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   because Jesus.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   Why was that written like that?
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   Each ceremony,
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   each memorial, remembrance, the lamp
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   stand, the altar, the curtain, it tells you how
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   many rings
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   on the curtain there is. It's like why are you doing
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   this? Why do you tell us what to cover it with?
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   Why do you say that it needs to be done this way?
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   Why do you say that it needs to be sprinkled like this?
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   How come it has to be this animal?
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   Why is it all there? What is the purpose
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   to show who God is?
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   To show why
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   reasonable worship
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   is meant to look a certain way.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   That that
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   was meant to show reasonable worship.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   Sometimes it feels unreasonable.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   Really? All of that?
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   Sometimes we like to wipe it away
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   because Jesus came and fulfilled it all.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   And yet what
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   that was trying to show was who God is.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   Do you know what the most used phrase in
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Leviticus is?
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   I am the Lord.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   That's the most used phrase.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   Because of who God is.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   All these instructions given, not arbitrarily
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   but to show He is. Show who
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   He is. That He is the same God
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   there and now that He is the same God
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   now. Jesus might have
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   accomplished this but worship
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   still matters. Now instead of a temple
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   we'd have to travel to.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   This is a scarier concept. It doesn't
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   just wipe away the idea of the temple.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   He says that we are the temple of God.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   And He uses this
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   imagery to show
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   something in this passage in Romans
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   12, 1-2.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   That we are the living sacrifices.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   Meticulousness
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   needs to be found in our worship. Not as a burden
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   of rules to follow but truly
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   knowing who He is. Allowing
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   the seriousness of that to dictate
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   and infiltrate how we live
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   and that our decisions matter because we
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   are sacrifices to God. Our
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   worship matters.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   So the
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   one who sacrifices without the proper direction
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   towards the goal is not
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   allowed to say just take whatever I give.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   You'll receive it, right?
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   And God says no to that.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   Because any sacrifice given
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   without the proper direction, without
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   the heaven word goal
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   is considered detestable
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   in His sight. It's evil. No matter
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   how much it mimics the true thing, the
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   direction, the goal of sacrifice
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   is everything.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   And so He
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   says in this passage even
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   to be acceptable to God.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   That's the goal. Not just
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   sacrifice but acceptable sacrifice
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   is the goal.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   It's what God wants.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   So in our day-to-day living, our lives
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   fundamentally changes. The way
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   we make decisions,
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   the expedentia of our resources, it
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   fundamentally changes. We don't
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   live for ourselves. Our prayers change.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   When we say your kingdom come, your will
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   be done. Even as Jesus stated
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   in the garden, not my will but your will be done,
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   we're right there with Him.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   Our money then is not God's money and so we don't
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   use it like that. Our time is not
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   our time, it's God's time so we
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   don't use it like that. Our energy is God's
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   energy. Our bodies
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   belong to God. There is no desire
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   that we have
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   that's meant to be isolated to
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   just me. There's no
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   energy that we're going to be expending
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   as a church that's isolated to just what we're doing
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   here at Berean.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   They're to be wrapped up in His desires.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   What is the goal and direction of
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   your life?
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   Our eating
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   has a goal. Our
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   relationships has a goal. Our
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   rest has a goal. We engage in entertainment
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   with a goal. We play video games
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   with a goal. We play sports and we
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   watch it with a goal.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   It can't all just be a neutral thing.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   It can't be
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   where the ultimate goal is a side point.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   This has to be the center. There's something
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   that brings all this together.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   There's intention. There's purpose.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   There's direction in our lives. And all
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   that we do reflects the direction.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   What has our direction been?
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   On the Korea
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   trip, we felt it. Many
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   of us have felt it.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   Just in
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   general. We rested with the goal. We woke up
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   with the goal. We read
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   with the goal. We hung out with the goal. Even our
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   leisure time, it was with the goal
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   in mind.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   So it was very freeing.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   We had the same goal.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   This idea
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   of sacrifice
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   acceptable to God. This idea of
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   worship means that it needs to be in spirit and
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   truth.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   It can't be just desires.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   Just because you say you want
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   to live for God's glory and you
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   try really, really hard
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   in that, doesn't mean that
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   God is pleased by your life.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   Doesn't mean that God is pleased by
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   mine. It has to be saturated in
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   truth. If you've ever heard
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   that phrase, someone can be sincere and be
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   sincerely wrong.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   That's what we're looking at.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   In 2 Samuel chapter 6 verse 6,
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   the story of Uzzah, it says, "But when they came
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   to the threshing floor of Nakhon,
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   Uzzah reached out toward the ark of God
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   and took hold of it, for the oxen nearly upset it.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   And the anger of the Lord burned against Uzzah,
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   and God struck him down there for his irreverence,
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   and he died there by the ark of God."
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   I don't think he had the wrong desire.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   What was happening
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   here in this passage is that he was terribly mistaken.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   His sight was not
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   based on the truth and on the reality.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   Him saying, "I didn't know,"
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   didn't cut it, because truth mattered
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   here. Him saying that, "I didn't
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   understand
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   the amount of people that say
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   I didn't mean to."
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   So what of us?
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   If that's the case,
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   then God's truth matters.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   Truth matters in our worship.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   If you want to be acceptable to
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   God, it needs to be based upon His truth.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   You can't just have an emotional
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   feeling at church
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   and say, "That must be God."
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   And how we think about love,
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   acceptability,
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   the world.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   Some of us were at a conference
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   somewhat recently, and I was pretty disappointed
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   by one of the things that was coming out as a
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   marching cry from many churches.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   That we must change the way
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   we're doing things because the world is watching.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   I understand
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   the sentiment and parts of it.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   I really, okay, I get it.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   But I believe
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   the whole of the matter of this was to be
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   100% false.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   Because as a matter of why
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   we make the decisions, we do have
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   everything to do with God's sight.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   In Galatians 1, verse 10, it says, "For am I now
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   seeking the favor of men or of God, or am I
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   striving to please men? If I were still
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   trying to please men, I would not be a bondservant of
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   Christ." The sentiment
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   that ought to drive us in our direction,
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   in our goals, in our worship, is that God
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   is watching. We want to be acceptable
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   in His sight. We strive not to
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   please man, but to please God.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   So
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   thankful Pride Month is over.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   I believe there are so many
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   so-called churches that have compromised because they
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   have good intentions to try to be a good witness.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   Good intentions to try to love people,
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   but they've missed the whole point.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   Good intentions are not enough and must be saturated
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   in the truth for us to be
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   acceptable
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   in the sight of God. For Him to receive
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   the worship, there are many churches who
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   are not giving Him acceptable worship.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   No matter how sincere
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   our hearts.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   And I'm going to pull ourselves away from this
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   because Berean Community Church is not immune
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   to this.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   It is in our church. It is in our
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   hearts.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   I believe
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   many of us are fooling ourselves into
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   thinking that we're giving God worship when He is not
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   receiving it.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   That we have been keeping
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   worship. We have been keeping our
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   hearts from Him.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   So that was the first point, the goal.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   It's not just sacrifice, but acceptable sacrifice.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   The second goal,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   the second point, the goal is not
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   conformed, but transformed.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   In Romans chapter 12 verse 2.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   He doesn't
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   want us to be conformed
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   to this world, but to be transformed
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   in a way.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   So it says in verse 2, "And do not be transformed
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   your mind, so that you may prove what the will
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   of God is, that which is good and acceptable
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   and perfect."
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   Today,
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   there are many ways
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   in which we can attack this,
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   and look at this,
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   but I'm going to be not
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   looking at this idea of conforming to the
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   secular world, but I want to call
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   on us not to be conformed to the so-called believing
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   world. This includes
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   of course those who are heretics
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   and theologically and doctrinally false in their
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   teaching,
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   but this also includes what has crept into our own
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   circle of churches.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   That we must not become a church that conforms to the
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   world of churches that have been erroneously
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   and sinfully built, and I felt
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   this in Korea.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   In Korea, there are many huge mega churches
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   that have been built. Some of the biggest churches
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   in the world are in Korea.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   We pass by huge
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   churches,
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   and as we look at what's going on
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   in Korea, one of the questions that came to mind is,
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   is the spirit alive
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   in these churches?
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   Is there obedience
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   happening in these churches? Is there true
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   worship going on in them?
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   With tens of thousands of people
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   packing the pews
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   week after week after
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   week, and I thought, what is going
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   to happen if it's not?
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   What is going to happen when
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   the previous generations of Christians
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   die off, when the current generation
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   where there is just a little percentage
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   of believers that
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   reside in Korea, and it's a predominantly
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   unbelieving society,
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   that these buildings then will become
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   shells?
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   Empty buildings that might have these pews,
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   crosses made of wood, and cafes that
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   have nice coffee that are being presented
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   in them, projectors
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   that cost thousands, and music
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   equipment, and banners that come
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   up with themes just like ours,
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   year after year after year,
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   rolled up and put
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   away, great and grand
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   productions of VBS and retreats.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   Many in Korea were saying that the
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   Korean church has lost its witness, and that was
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   heartbreaking for me to hear.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   That the reason why
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   people didn't want to go to church was because of
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   the church.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   Fleshliness is not just secular
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   worldliness. It can also be a religious
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   on site. You can conform to the
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   world of nominal
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   religion. Religion can be conformity
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   to the world. In fact, at the end, the
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   Antichrist is going to mimic Christ, right?
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   It's not just going to be something that is our religious.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   In the
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   book of Revelation, we see that, right? That there's going to be
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   this mimicking that goes on. There's going to be
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   worship that goes on.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   The false prophet mimicking the spirit.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   The dragon mimicking
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   the father. There's going to be an altar
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   that mimics the altar. There's going to be
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   worship.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   And it's going to look a lot
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   closer to Christianity than we feel comfortable
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   with. So we can say what we want about Islam
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   and Marxism and all these things that's taking
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   over, but all these
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   things are being pushed for in the name of goodness
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   and the name of righteousness and the name of
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   what is truth.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   But humans can yell as
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   loud as we want, but what
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   matters is the truth. Is it acceptable to
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   God or not? And so, to be
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   acceptable, we must not be conformed to the world
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   but be transformed.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   Chapter 12, verse 2
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   again. We must be transformed.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   Transformation can only happen by the
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   power of the spirit. It's not something that you can
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   generate with programs. It's not something
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   that you can do as you go through a curriculum.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   It's not something that you can do as you just say the
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   right things to your children. It can only
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   happen by the power of the spirit.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   And that's why Paul says, "Not with eloquence
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   of words," he says, "I came with
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   demonstration of power, of spirit."
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   We
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   must be transformed.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   There are people at our church who
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   have written me encouragement notes before and they
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   say, "You seem so happy and I know that that's
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   the joy of Christ." I'm so thankful for those
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   encouragement notes, but one of the crazy things
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   that I think back on,
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   one of the things that kind of disturbs me is
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   how do I know that that is of Christ?
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   Because before I became
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   a Christian, when I was in high school, you know
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   those yearbook things? When I was most likely to be
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   the next president of the United States, things like that?
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   I got the
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   most happy.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   That was what I want.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   Most happy.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   People are saying, "He's so
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   smiley all the time. So
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   happy."
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   That was as a non-believer.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   How do I know?
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   What is that?
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   I'm not saying what you're seeing is false. Don't
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   like when you see smiley.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   That's fleshly.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   Please don't think that of me. But at the end,
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   how do you know? How do I know?
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   How do I know there's a transformation?
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   It has to be the transformation
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   that occurs inside of us.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   It can't just be a
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   shell. It can't just be programs.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   It can't just be what you hear when I pray in front of
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   you. It needs to be the inner man. It needs to
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   be real. Cain and Abel, they both
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   presented sacrifice to God
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   and only one was accepted because
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   Cain was conforming to the expectation.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   He was not transformed in his heart.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   He says that this needs to be the renewing of
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   your mind because sanctification has
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   a goal. It needs to be the renewal of the mind.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   This is not a renewing as
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   we think about library books that needs to be
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   renewed from time to time. This renewal
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   means that it is something
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   that is a complete overhaul in your life.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   It's a death to present self and
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   alive to new self. It is
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   transformation. That our minds
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   are different than the way we used
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   to think. Everything
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   is different. And so we will not
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   say it's unreasonable when the Bible says that
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   we must deny ourselves, take up the cross
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   to follow Christ because all of our
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   lives are wrapped up in this idea.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   And so in Colossians chapter
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   3 verse 5 it says, "Therefore consider the members
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   of your earthly body as dead to immorality,
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   impurity, passion, evil desire, and
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   greed, which amounts to idolatry.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   For it is because of these things that the wrath of God will come
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   upon the sons of disobedience.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   And in them you also once walked
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   when you were living in them."
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   He says that's gone.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   In Colossians chapter 3 verse
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   10 it shows you then what you are to be renewed to.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   Put on a new self which is being renewed
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   to a true knowledge according to the image
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   of the one who created him, a renewal in which
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   there is no distinction between Greek and Jew,
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   circumcised, uncircumcised, barbarian,
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   Scythian, slave, and free man.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   But Christ is all.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   That's the renewal. It has nothing to do
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   with our identity, it has nothing to do with
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   all of these other things, everything to do
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   with Christ.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   If we do not have our minds renewed,
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   then there is no way for us to prove the will of God.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   The direction here,
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   God's will, this is the whole point,
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   death to self, life to God.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   And so he says
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   in Romans chapter 12 verse 1 through 2,
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   "The goal is to prove God's will."
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   What is God's will?
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   What does it mean to prove God's will?
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   That means that our lives
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   become proof, that our lives
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   point, that our lives actually
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   are what brings
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   God's will to fruition.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   Not mine.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   Worship of God defined
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   by him, not me. Love of God defined
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   by him, not me.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   Weeks ago PPK brought up,
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   Pastor Peter Kim brought up that if people
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   knew him, he said his children would not get him
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   Disneyland tickets because
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   they knew him. And if we know God,
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   just giving is not enough.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   He uses these words,
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   good, acceptable,
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   and man,
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   the most unfair word of them all, perfect.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   That that's what our lives are to be.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   How are we to know
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   if we are presenting our
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   lives as a sacrifice that's good,
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   presentable, acceptable,
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   and perfect to him?
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   So this is where the rubber meets the road and
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   I'll conclude with application.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   Because I think this is where
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   direction happens.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   It's not just
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   truths that are just points in our lives.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   Every Sunday,
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   right now, it's a point.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   We're looking at scripture and there's a
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   truth that's been presented to us.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   Direction happens when we
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   acknowledge it and we
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   submit to it.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   That we make changes. Application.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   Look at three quick
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   ones that are on the negative
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   sphere.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   Our application, to have a goal
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   to this upward
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   call is not simply being
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   a nicer or better person.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   Sometimes I think that's our
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   goal. We're trying to be better people.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   So I'm
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   impatient, so I want to be more patient.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   I'm angry, so I want to
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   be more kind.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   Doesn't it feel that way sometimes?
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   And we have a goal
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   that is altogether just apart
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   from God's goals.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   And so we end up creating these goals that
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   were meant to be byproducts.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   Of course,
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   I'm not saying don't fight
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   impatience. I'm not saying
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   you have anger. That's okay.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   That's not what we're saying, right?
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   What we're saying is when we look at this, that can't be
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   our goal. Just simply becoming a nicer, better
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   person. That means our measure,
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   our gauge, our barometer is broken
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   if we think that that's what's causing us to
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   change because I just don't feel like I'm
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   a nice person.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   The second one is not simply
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   serving however we want. That we
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   think that if we write our names down under
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   this ministry or the fact that I'm
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   actually going to Bible study here
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   or the fact that I'm investing in this person there.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   Simply serving however we want
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   is not the goal.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   That might not be received
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   by God.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   Remember, if I have not love, then it is
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   nothing. It's very clear
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   that it could be nothing what we give.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   Thirdly, not simply doing our best not to
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   sin.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   We get around in our circle
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   saying this is how I've sinned and please
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   pray for me and it just becomes a perpetual
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   goal of trying to fight
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   sin in our lives. That is not the goal.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   We have to
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   sharpen our intentions. We have to ask
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   this question, what does God want?
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   What is his goal?
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   We don't get to just answer that. We don't just
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   get to fill in the blank however we want.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   God has presented his goal to us in his
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   scriptures.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   And so we need to ask ourselves, what does
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   God want and how then can I live in accordance
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   to his desires?
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   So then we need to look at our lives.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   Identify. We need to
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   diagnose and we need to plan.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   We need to do it. We need to identify
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   the things that are going on. We need to diagnose
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   the problems, the things that have been causing
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   me to be away from this
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   and the things that do cause me to
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   move forward into his directions and
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   goals and then to plan it out how
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   I'm going to accomplish this.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   I was very close to just passing out pieces of paper today
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   and asking everyone to write down
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   what is something that is
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   killing
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   us when it comes to
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   desiring his goals.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   What is the thing that we can cultivate, the good things
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   that cause us to go towards
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   his plans?
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   And then to say, how are we going to do this?
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   But that's something that must be done.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   Ask what it is that God wants
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   in our lives.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   Personally it starts.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   Let it leak over into the
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   ministry that we have with one another
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   and then think globally.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   What does God want for the world?
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   I think that's how the Christian
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   grows.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   Over in Korea it just felt like that again.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   It feels like that every time.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   You feel like this is the missing ingredient.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   Sitting around
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   doing seminars and all these different things
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   which are very, very important and yet if there is
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   no goal and purpose to it,
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   it all gets constipated
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   up in our church.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   So to conclude,
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   ultimately it's the Great Commission.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   You see where we're going with this, I hope.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   That's God's goal.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   So in application what that means is
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   how
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   are we going to use our time to accomplish
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   God's goals?
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   How are we going to use our
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   career to accomplish God's goal?
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   How are we going
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   to use our energies?
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   What will our leisure time look like?
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   What about our relationships?
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   What about our demands and the
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   things that we say we must have?
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   How are we going to think about our children and how we
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   raise them or whether we even have them or not?
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   What are we going to do?
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   I hope that we can ask
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   this of ourselves
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   and really ask, "God, are we
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   just giving lip service?
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   Saying that we want your goals,
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   your plans?"
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   Yet in my life it's reflecting something
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]   a little different.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   And instead of awakening guilt, I hope this
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   is God's desire
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]   for the believer to say that we
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   want to live in
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]   accordance to him. Let's pray.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   Heavenly Father, I pray
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   that you would cause our church
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   to be one that
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   doesn't just sing and
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   pray and say the right words.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   A God that we truly do
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   out of the foundation of what we know
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   project forward
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   in a direction to the proper goal.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   I believe
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   God that there are many goals in my life
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   that are wrong.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   It's the wrong way.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   And my energies have
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   betrayed me.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   My energies have shown me which
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   direction that I'm going.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   I pray,
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   Lord, that you would start with us
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   one at a time.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   But God, we present
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   our church to you and ask
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   because our desire is to be
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   a living sacrifice.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   Holy, pleasing,
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   acceptable in your sight.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   Help us to do this as we
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   meditate on your word.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]   As we come to know who you are
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   to deeper and deeper degrees. In Jesus' name
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   I pray. Amen. Stand together.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   Sing "All I Want."
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   All I want,
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   how dear,
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   build my life
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   upon.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   All this world
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   reveres

[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:51.000]   Father, I pray
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   that it would be out of a great love for you
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   that our desires change to your ends.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   And I pray, Father, that our
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   lives would effectively
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000]   be different.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   Lord, that we would have goals
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   and that they would be yours.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   And Father, help us to change.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   Help us to lay down
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000]   our lives as living sacrifices to you.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   May the grace
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God the

[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   be with us all, both now and forevermore.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   Amen.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   God sent
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   his Son,
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   then called him
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   Jesus.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   He came to
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   love,
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   heal,
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   and forbear.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   He lived
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   and died
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   to buy
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   my heart away.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   An empty
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   grave is there
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   to my
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   Savior
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   rest.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   Because
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   he lives,
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   I can face
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   tomorrow.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   Because
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   he lives,
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000]   all fear
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   is gone.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   Because I
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   know
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   he
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000]   holds the future.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000]   And life
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   is worth the
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   living just
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   because he
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   lives.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   Heaven's
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000]   glow on earth,
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000]   my heart is strong
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   to self-exalting.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   Help me
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   seek your
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   kingdom first,
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   as Jesus walked.
