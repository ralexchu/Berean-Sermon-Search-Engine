[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 8, we're going to continue our studies
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.360]   in the priesthood of Christ.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:18.720]   Hebrews chapter 8, verses 1 through 8.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.760]   Hebrews chapter 8, verses 1 through 8, reading out of the book of Hebrews, NASB.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.600]   Now the main point in what has been said is this, we have such a high priest who has taken
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.800]   his seat at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in heavens, a minister in the
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.840]   sanctuary and in the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched not man.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.440]   Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, so it is necessary that
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.880]   this high priest also have something to offer.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.080]   Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.920]   the gifts according to the law, who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things,
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.560]   just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.740]   For see he says that you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain.
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.520]   But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry by as much as he is also the mediator of a
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.000]   better covenant which has been enacted on better promises.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.320]   Let's pray.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.320]   Heavenly Father we pray for your anointing.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.120]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to continue to guide and lead us and your word Lord God would
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.540]   cause us to be anchored in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.040]   If our hearts and our mind Lord has been distracted in anything else but you, we pray Father that
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.960]   this morning you would teach us that we may hear from you and that we may follow your
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.280]   son and your son alone.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.440]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.520]   You know as we study the Bible one of the most important things in understanding what
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.000]   the Bible says is what?
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.200]   Context right?
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.200]   You have to understand everything in context.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.760]   So you have to understand the verse in the context of the passage.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.480]   You have to understand the passage in the context of the letter.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.480]   And you have to understand the letter in the context of the covenant, the New Testament
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.040]   or the Old Testament.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.960]   And you have to understand everything in the context of the redemptive history, meaning
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.400]   the meta narrative, the large narrative that God is giving.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.320]   So when we study the details obviously we're studying the author, we're studying the recipients,
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.240]   we're studying the culture behind it.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.720]   But at the same time there is a larger picture that we have to learn how to connect to which
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.960]   we call the meta narrative.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.560]   And if we don't connect it, we don't know how it belongs to God's redemptive history,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.120]   you're going to miss the whole point because the true author of the Bible is the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.840]   There's only one author.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.720]   Even though he used different people at different times to deal with certain specific things,
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.880]   the Bible was never meant to be read in sections.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.440]   The sections need to be understood in the context of the larger book, the Old Testament
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.680]   and New Testament because they are cohesive.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.880]   The reason why I say that, without understanding the meta narrative, the book of Jonah becomes
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.480]   a story about a man who decides not to obey God and then he gets swallowed up by a whale.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.040]   And so don't mess with God, right?
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.960]   Or the whale's going to come and get you.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.320]   The end.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.680]   The book of Hosea is about how we need to be gracious to prostitutes.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.280]   Homer is going to keep prostituting herself, but we should love people like we love prostitutes.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.080]   The end.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.440]   If we don't understand how this fits into the larger narrative.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.560]   The book of Jonah was written as a rebuke to the nation of Israel in the context of
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.560]   God calling the nation of Israel to be a blessing to the rest of the nation.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.400]   His intent was always, in Genesis chapter 12, to bless them and that they would be a
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.840]   blessing to the rest of the world.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.400]   So God's purpose was the world, was always the world.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.080]   But by the time of Jonah being written, they didn't care about the rest of the world, only
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.080]   about themselves.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.380]   And that's why the letter ends with rebuke to Jonah.
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.400]   What is it to you that I show mercy to these people?
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   The end.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.640]   That's how it ends.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.560]   So if you don't connect that to the meta narrative, it just becomes a good story to tell in Sunday
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.440]   school about don't mess with God.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.080]   Or stay away from whales if you're disobedient, right?
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.920]   Or something to that effect, right?
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.960]   Book of Hosea is, again, a rebuke to the nation of Israel.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.320]   And the way that God calls Hosea to love this prostitute, Gomer, is the way that God continues
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.560]   to love the nation of Israel and God's people.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.200]   And he's warning them at some point, this grace is going to run out.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.200]   So you need to repent.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.280]   So he's trying to bring them back to repentance.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.120]   Now I say all of this is because not only book of Jonah or Hosea, every part of scripture
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.840]   we have to keep asking what is the main point.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.320]   We've been studying the Melchizedek, the priesthood of Jesus, of Melchizedek, which Jesus came
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.620]   under.
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.000]   We started that in chapter six.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.880]   We took a long break and then we picked it back up in chapter seven.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.760]   We're right in the middle of things.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.040]   He's going to lead to a better ministry, better covenant, and then we're going to get into
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.800]   chapter nine, the old and the new covenant.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.800]   And so we're going to be on this subject, even if we don't mention Melchizedek every
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   single Sunday.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.160]   We're going to be on this subject for a while.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.760]   But the goal of this study isn't simply so that you can say, you know what, Melchizedek
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.840]   is a hard, hard to understand, but good thing we went through it.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.680]   I have some knowledge about who he is.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.320]   That's not the point.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.360]   If you, if that's your point, you missed the whole point, right?
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.880]   In fact, some, anybody who studied the book of Hebrews may be eager to jump to chapter
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.360]   11 or chapter 12.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.440]   Tell me what to do, right?
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.360]   What is it that we're supposed to do?
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.560]   Chapter seven, eight, and nine is the core of the book of Hebrews.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.400]   Because if you don't fully grasp who Jesus is, whatever it is that you do is going to
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.160]   be founded upon whatever you think he is, not who he is.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.660]   And that's the common mistake that churches make.
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.480]   When we get riled up into action without having a good foundation of who Jesus is and what
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.440]   he calls us to do, we can be well-meaning and give all our efforts and pour all our
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.520]   energy into things that in the end may have nothing to do with God.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.400]   So we need to make sure that we are completely anchored in Christ, that no matter what it
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.560]   is that we endeavor to do, that it is because this is what Christ would do.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.240]   This is what Christ calls us to do.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:54.880]   So to make it easy, chapter eight actually begins by telling us now the main point.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.400]   This is the main point.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.000]   Sometimes you study the Bible and you really have to search for it, because the main point
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.240]   is kind of scattered everywhere.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.680]   And then after you study, you say, "Oh, this is the main point."
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.680]   Well, he makes it easy for us.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.480]   Verse one, he says, "Now the main point in what has been said is this."
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.720]   So what he has to say, basically we need to pay attention.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.200]   Because he says this is the main point.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.640]   This is the reason what we've been studying.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.200]   This is what he wants us to get, the main point.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.680]   And so the next phrase that comes really is a summary of what he's going to say in the
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.040]   next four or five verses.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.680]   So there's three things he says.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.680]   The main point is this.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:40.560]   We have such a high priest, meaning Christ, who has taken his seat, number one.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.080]   And so we're going to be talking about what does that mean for him to take his seat.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.720]   Second, he's taken his seat at the right hand of the throne.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.000]   What does it mean for his seat to be at the right hand?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.160]   And then third, that this throne is the majesty in heaven.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.800]   So that kind of summarizes everything that he really wants to say.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:08.060]   And then the conclusion of that, because this is who he is and this is what he has done,
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:13.320]   he concludes in verse six by saying, "But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry,
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.540]   by as much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.400]   a better promises."
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.400]   That's his point.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:26.800]   Because remember, he's talking to a group of people who are drifting back into their
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.920]   old system, the Judaistic system, because it was easier and it was much more tangible.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.000]   That's what their friends were in.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.080]   So in order to avoid hardship in life, they were trying to blend the old life and the
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.760]   new life.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:50.200]   And so the point of all of this is, you either don't understand who Christ is, or you've
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.720]   drifted so far that you've forgotten.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.680]   Whatever the case is, and whatever the reason you have drifted, it is important for us to
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.120]   be re-anchored in Christ.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.120]   And it's no different today.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.200]   I think, you know, either there are people in the church who really don't care.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.320]   Just tell me that I believe Jesus and I'm going to go to heaven, and everything in between
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.640]   really doesn't matter because all I really want from Christ is to go to heaven, not to
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.640]   go to hell.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   That's it.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:23.320]   And there's a lot of people in the church who really believe very little, if any, of
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:28.360]   Christ and it is enough that they've been baptized and that they're going to go to heaven.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.240]   And everything in between is just not that important.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.120]   They'll never say it because in the church culture you'll be rebuked for that, but in
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.720]   everything in their life, every thought, what they're interested in, what makes them happy,
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.800]   what they get excited about, really has nothing to do with Christ.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.720]   It's just a barrier.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.560]   It's just a minimum thing that I need to do so that I can feel safe about not going to
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.040]   hell.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.520]   And we may find that at the end of all of this, that they never had faith to begin with.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.040]   And then there are Christians who genuinely are just entangled with things in life and
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.480]   they are constantly just being tempted back and forth.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.080]   And all the more why we need to constantly focus our attention on Christ so that we may
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.680]   be anchored.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.760]   Or we have such a superficial understanding of the Savior that we sing about, that we
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.960]   say is the most important thing in our life, but we've never invested any time really searching,
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.520]   really knowing.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:29.240]   And it is enough to read little articles and hear sermons once a week and that's enough.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.880]   And as a result of that, as a superficial understanding of who Christ is, it's caused
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.200]   me to be superficially anchored in Christ.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.800]   So whenever there is a wind of doctrine, any cultural change, anything that's going on
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.400]   around us, we get tossed back and forth, back and forth because we're not anchored in Christ.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.560]   All the more why we need to be anchored in Christ.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.000]   So let's begin.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.360]   If this is the main point of all things, and we have such a high priest, the first thing
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.560]   that he says is he has taken his seat.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.320]   Again, if you understand that without context, what's the big deal?
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.080]   You're sitting down, so Jesus is sitting down.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.440]   I was sitting down and I just stood up.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.440]   What's the big deal?
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:14.080]   Well, the way that, again, a Jew would have heard this, it's very significant because
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.360]   in Hebrews 10-11, this is how priests are described.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:24.600]   Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.920]   which can never take away sins.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.600]   But he, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.200]   God.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:40.340]   So he makes a distinction that all other priests were standing, but Jesus sat down.
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:46.320]   And there's huge significance in that because at the tabernacle, there was no seat.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.880]   It was not like a place like, "Oh, I'm so tired.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.440]   I'm going to go into the tent and rest for a while."
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.400]   That is not where the tabernacle was.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.840]   You came in, you did the job, whether you were a priest or whether you were the one
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.440]   who brought the sacrifice, it was a sacred place.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.920]   You did your work and you get out.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.320]   There was no other seat except one.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.320]   Do you know where that seat was?
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:14.920]   Some of you guys who were alive when we were doing the book of Leviticus, right?
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.480]   Do you remember?
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.280]   There's only one seat in the tabernacle.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.080]   Do you remember where that was?
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.260]   The mercy seat.
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:29.680]   If you remember the mercy seat, it's described as the two wings of seraphim, and at the middle,
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.560]   there's a seat.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.680]   And nobody's able to sit there.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:39.200]   The high priest could only go into the holy of holies, the inner chamber, and he would
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.200]   do his business.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:47.040]   He would sprinkle the blood of the animals, representing cleansing of the sins.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:53.320]   And so the mercy seat was the place where the holy God came and met the sinners.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.840]   So that's where God met Israel.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:03.160]   And the high priest, representing the nation of Israel, God's people, met God at that mercy
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.080]   seat.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.760]   That mercy seat was not for him.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.280]   If he sat down there, he would have died.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:17.880]   In fact, it was such a scary, terrifying thing to enter the holy of holies, God told Aaron
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:25.400]   to put a bell on him so that when he went in, people outside could hear that possibly,
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.160]   maybe he would die.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.160]   And that's exactly what happened.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.500]   Remember the very first gift that is offered up, Neideb and Nebihu?
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.800]   Because they didn't do it right, they died.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.960]   And that was just a regular sacrifice.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.640]   The high priest was to enter into the most sacred place.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:50.040]   So if these two offerers died giving a regular sacrifice, how much more would a high priest
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:55.720]   be in danger if he went in there nonchalantly and didn't follow the prescription that God
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.720]   told him?
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.760]   So he actually had to put a bell on.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:06.560]   So the significance behind when he says, "We have such a high priest who has taken his
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.680]   seat."
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:14.840]   It has huge theological implication because the only seat that existed at the tabernacle
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:22.580]   was at the mercy seat, meaning Christ came and he sat on that seat.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:28.020]   That he was the only one who was going to mediate between sinners and God.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.520]   If he was a man, he would have died.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:36.780]   If he wasn't a God, he wouldn't be able to enter.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.780]   He was the perfect mediator between God and man.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.720]   And that's what it means that he sat down.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.560]   In other words, he came and he never came back out.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.960]   Just like every other priest, they went and did their work, they stood up and then they
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   had to leave.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.560]   But Jesus came in, he sat on his throne, and he never came out.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.680]   In other words, his work of mediation was finished.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.640]   That's what he means.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:08.140]   That only Christ, who came in the order of Melchizedek, King of righteousness, King of
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:12.980]   peace, sat down.
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:18.360]   Now again, when we read this not understanding the context, it's like, "Oh, he sat down.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.360]   He must have been tired."
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:25.380]   No, it means that he was the only one who was qualified.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.360]   It meant that he sat down and never came back out.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.360]   He sat down on the throne that even the most holiest of man, the high priest, could only
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.840]   do his work and come out.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.040]   That was his throne.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.860]   He sat down.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.860]   That's what that means.
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:45.400]   Secondly, it says he sat down at the right hand of the throne.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.140]   Now the term right hand, we use that all the time too.
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.800]   Somebody says, "He's my right hand man."
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.980]   What we mean by that is, I have full confidence in him.
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.600]   He has the same authority.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.040]   I've given, he's my ambassador, so he's my right hand man.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.920]   Whatever I need to do, he's the guy that I rely on to get it done.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.640]   That's what we mean by right hand.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.440]   The term right hand in the Bible is a very significant term because it is used at the
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.080]   throne of Christ repeatedly.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:20.200]   Psalm chapter 110, Matthew 22, Ephesians 1, Romans 8, Mark 16, Acts chapter 2, and chapter
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.140]   7, Hebrews chapter 10, 13.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:29.420]   Over and over again, there's a reason why the throne of God, throne of Christ, the mercy
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:34.700]   seat is mentioned as the right hand of God.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.660]   We can get into the deep theological meaning behind that, but I just want to highlight
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:46.740]   for the sake of time this morning, that basically means it is a place of power and authority.
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:53.020]   Typically when we think of sitting down, we think of resting.
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.620]   But that term means something different when we're referring to the king.
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.860]   When we say the king is on his throne, what do we mean by that?
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.060]   We don't mean, oh, the king is resting.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.700]   Usually when we say the king is on his throne, it means that he is ruling.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.260]   There's somebody in charge.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.000]   Somebody is taking care of his kingdom.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   That's what we mean.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.920]   So, a regular person sitting simply just means we're sitting.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.240]   But for him to sit at the right hand of God, meaning that he is sitting as the king.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:32.300]   That's why he is described as a king of righteousness and king of mercy.
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:37.100]   He is sitting on the throne at the right hand because he is continuing to rule.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:41.240]   In Psalm chapter 118, verse 16, the right hand of the Lord is exalted.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.000]   The right hand of the Lord does valiantly.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.680]   Meaning, his position at the right hand is being exalted for God's purpose, his work.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.080]   Psalm 110, verse 1, the Lord says to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.320]   a footstool for your feet."
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.680]   In other words, he's not sitting on his throne just resting.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.920]   He's not exalted and just kind of receiving the glory.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:13.280]   He's sitting on his throne at the right hand of God to continue the work of conquering
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.720]   what he needs to conquer.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.400]   And what does he need to conquer?
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.960]   First Corinthians 15, 25-26.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.440]   For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:28.600]   The last enemy that will be abolished is death.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.640]   Now let me stop right here to make sure that we understand.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:37.760]   So that this doesn't just kind of go all over your head and then it's just theological mumbo-jumbo.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:45.280]   The point that he's trying to make is the primary work of our King, who's sitting at
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:52.160]   the right hand of the throne of God, is to conquer our sins.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.720]   Which is what is causing death.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:05.840]   Now the reason why this is so important is first of all, we recognize that we are at war.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.840]   That's what the Bible tells us.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:13.000]   One of the primary problems that Christians get into is especially because we live in
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.880]   a country where we're not threatened with violence, at least not right now.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.080]   We live in peace and so we have the blessing of worrying about the future of our children
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:27.520]   where many, many people around the world, that's not even on their thought.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.080]   You know, mention garage sale when you travel.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.080]   How many people understand what that is?
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.800]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.960]   Garage sale is for rich people who have extra stuff that they bought they don't need that
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.960]   they need to get rid of.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.240]   That's what a garage sale is.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.840]   That's only for rich people.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.040]   Majority of the people around the world, that's not a thing.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.120]   They don't have extra stuff.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.600]   They're just trying to feed their kids.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.720]   And even in their faith, just to get together is a big deal.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.800]   You know, I think about, you know, us because of pandemic and everybody just went and we
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.120]   had the luxury of going online.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.560]   That's not a thing in majority of the world.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.280]   Just going online, oh, we just go online.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.040]   And then when it's over, we just come back.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.040]   That's not a thing.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.720]   Majority of the people in the world don't have that option.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.040]   If they don't get together, they don't get together.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:17.560]   See, because you and I live in such comfort, we have a hard time understanding that there
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.160]   is a spiritual battle going on until something happens around us.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.360]   All of a sudden we get shocked like, oh my gosh, this is going on.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.600]   This is the state of mankind.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.400]   It's just that you and I live in a place where we constantly forget.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.320]   See, he's on his throne.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:40.440]   And that's why he called his disciples to go to the remotest part of the world to make
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.440]   disciples.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.520]   In other words, to join him in his endeavor to get the gospel out.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:52.720]   So every Christian, every church, its primary mission is to preach the gospel.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.000]   It is the character of the church to care about the poor.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.560]   It is the character of the church to be concerned about injustice.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.920]   It is not the mission.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.360]   The mission is not different than the mission of Christ.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.960]   It is to preach the gospel and bring the lost into his kingdom.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:17.120]   And then when they are in the kingdom, the character of the church is to get involved
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.120]   and help.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.100]   See, he's sitting on the right throne, and that's why we have confidence to do what we
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.100]   need to do.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.160]   Romans 8, 33 to 35.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.960]   Who will bring a charge against God's elect?
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.760]   God is the one who justifies.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.760]   Who is the one who condemns?
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:35.520]   Christ Jesus is he who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God,
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.200]   who also intercedes for us.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.720]   Why do we have this confidence?
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.600]   Because he sits at the right hand of God.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.920]   That's the significance behind he sitting at the right hand.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.640]   Acts chapter 7, 55 to 56.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.400]   Here's something interesting.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:59.040]   This is when Stephen is being stoned, first martyr in the early church, and we see Christ
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.000]   at the right hand of God.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.400]   But the way he is described is interesting in verse 55.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.760]   "But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven."
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.480]   This is talking about Stephen as he is dying, he's looking into heaven.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:15.960]   "And saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:20.520]   And he said, 'Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.520]   hand of God.'"
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.480]   Now, first, there's two things I want you to observe here.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.240]   One, why didn't Jesus save him?
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.400]   If he was standing, he was so concerned, why didn't he save him?
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.360]   Why didn't he get down there and crush his enemies?
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.800]   Again, we'll talk about that.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.160]   But secondly, you see he is standing.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:52.620]   And his standing shows his compassion, that though he is the king, it is also the mercy
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.180]   seat that he's sitting in.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:23:01.180]   So his throne is where he represents the righteousness and justice of God, and where sinners come
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.940]   to see his mercy.
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:10.940]   And only Christ and Christ alone can carry out perfect justice and perfect mercy.
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:19.500]   See, when sinners try to carry out justice, we end up carrying out vengeance because of
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:26.020]   the sin in our hearts, because of bitterness and anger and coveting.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.200]   So when we seek justice, we usually don't stop with justice.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.980]   We usually seek vengeance.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.960]   We want them to get the message.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.780]   You killed one of ours, we killed two of yours.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:46.020]   That's why Jesus says the kingdom, the character of the kingdom is not to fight and destroy
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.460]   evil.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:51.660]   He says turn the other cheek and represent him.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:57.480]   We have to be careful that we do not seek justice as the world seeks justice.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:03.100]   Because if we seek justice as the world seeks justice, all it's going to do is to create
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.460]   anger on the other side.
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.220]   He's sitting on his throne.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.220]   He is the one.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:14.700]   That's why if there's any time where we need to come to his throne of righteousness, his
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.340]   throne of mercy, it is now.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.660]   Where we find wisdom with him.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.820]   We say what he says.
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.460]   We do what he does.
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:30.780]   Especially now.
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:35.340]   I'm trying not to get political.
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:41.580]   Right now you're hearing voices from all over, extreme voices from opposite ends.
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:47.540]   And the voices that you are hearing on both sides are confident that they are representing
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.620]   God.
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.420]   Which makes it very confusing for an average person.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.640]   I respect this guy.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.540]   This guy loves Christ and yet he's saying one thing.
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:02.540]   I respect this guy and he loves Christ and he's saying the other thing.
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:08.380]   There's a reason why the Bible says at the end time that delusion is going to be so great.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:15.660]   That even if the elect can be deceived, if it was possible, in other words, obviously
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:21.720]   it's not possible, but he's saying that delusion is going to be that strong.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.100]   Because our enemy is going to come as an angel of light.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.600]   So I want to warn our church again.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:33.820]   If there's any time that you need to be sober and pay very close attention to what is going
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:39.200]   on, what the scripture says, is now.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:46.040]   Before you fight for any cause, ask yourself, where are you with Christ?
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:54.840]   If you're not in the word and you're not praying, if you've never fought for souls, if you've
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:03.860]   never shared the gospel, don't make the first obedience in your life fighting for injustice.
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:09.040]   The first thing that we need to make sure is that we are obedient to what he has called
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.720]   us to that is clear.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:17.700]   So that does not mean that if we're Christians and if we study the Bible and we're sharing
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:22.480]   the gospel with our neighbors, that we shouldn't care about injustice.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   Not at all.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.640]   In the book of James, it says faith without deeds is death.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.800]   If you see the suffering of the people around you and it is clear what needs to be done
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.720]   and you stay silent, that's not love.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.220]   That's not love either.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:43.520]   But again, the caution is, whatever it is that we endeavor to do, we need to be sober.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:48.020]   We need to be careful that we need to make sure that it's the word of God and his spirit
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.840]   that is leading and guiding us.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:58.840]   So I want to say what I have always said and I'm going to say it again, be skeptical.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.240]   Examine everything.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.400]   Examine what you're reading.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.080]   Examine the statistics that you're hearing.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.740]   Examine who it's coming from, why it's coming, what the verses that they're quoting, where
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.800]   are they quoting that from.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.800]   Examine everything.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:19.120]   That makes sure that you, your eyes are fixed upon Christ because right now, if you are
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:28.960]   not, you may have strong passions but be very deceived if you're not anchored in Christ.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.840]   Our Savior is sitting on the throne and he's actively working.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.460]   This is nothing new.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:39.880]   But the spirit of delusion and divisiveness in the church is more powerful than I've ever
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.880]   seen it.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.880]   And I've seen it a lot.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.680]   It's more powerful now than I've ever seen it.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.760]   Third point that he makes is not only is he at the seat and he's at the right hand of
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.440]   God, he says he's sitting on the throne of majesty in heaven.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.280]   This is a heavenly throne.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.760]   Hebrews 8, 2-3, "A minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle which the Lord
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.080]   pitched not man."
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.080]   The true tabernacle.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.840]   Again, Hebrews 9, 24, "For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:15.800]   copy of the true one, but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us."
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.640]   In other words, all this stuff that people are drifting back into, your old way of life,
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:25.000]   the old things that you were thinking, they were only to prepare you for the reality that's
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.120]   coming in Christ.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.800]   So there is no substance there.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.240]   There is no reality there.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.600]   All of it was simply to prepare you for the coming of Christ.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:41.160]   In Hebrews 9, 11, "But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come,
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.920]   he entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is to
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.920]   say not of this creation."
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.680]   Now, this is huge.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:59.200]   Again, if you just read this like if you're reading any other book, it's just like, "Okay,
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:04.080]   Jesus, that's a true, it's a shadow in the reality that's coming."
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.840]   But I see so many Christians who completely miss this.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:17.800]   Even though it is very plain and obvious that Christ's kingdom and his tabernacle that he
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:23.800]   came to fulfill is not of this earth.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:29.740]   And that's why he says in verse 4 of chapter 8, "If he were on earth, he would not be a
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.480]   priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the law."
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:40.120]   In other words, if Jesus came to reestablish his kingdom on earth, he would be disqualified
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.440]   because he's not from the Levites.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.960]   He can't even be a priest.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:50.360]   Not only is he not a priest, he's the worst person to pick.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:58.680]   If the goal was to have a better country, to have better laws, to have a better economy,
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.480]   so that if we invest and fight for justice, that we're going to have a better country
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:08.040]   next five years, Jesus is not the man to lead us in that.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.240]   He wasn't rich.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.200]   He wasn't educated.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   He wasn't articulate.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.240]   He didn't come from any particular pedigree.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.800]   He had no political power.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:26.160]   So if his fight was to establish, reestablish his kingdom on earth, Jesus would have been
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.160]   the worst person.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.040]   He would have been disqualified just by his birth.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.960]   That's what he means by that.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.680]   Look at the way he's described in Isaiah 53, 2-3.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.200]   He grew up before him like a tender shoot.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.180]   Tender shoot meaning weak.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:46.520]   And like a root out of a parched ground where you wouldn't find any fruit.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:52.040]   He has no stately form or majesty that we should look upon him, nor appearance that
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.320]   we should be attracted to him.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.320]   You know what he just said?
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.080]   He's not a good-looking man.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:04.200]   That's pretty offensive and it's written in his, you know, his inerrant word.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.200]   So this is inerrant.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.200]   There's no error in this.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.600]   This is not somebody's opinion.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.200]   You rate him as, you rate him seven, I rate him 36.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.680]   God said he's not an attractive man.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.840]   There was nothing about him.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.000]   None of his, nothing in his state, his appearance, none of it would attract a human being to
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.760]   him.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:33.640]   If his goal was to be this dynamic leader to unite the world under his leadership to
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:38.800]   reestablish his kingdom, Jesus was not the man.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.520]   He would have been disqualified right off the bat.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:46.480]   He was despised and forsaken of men, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:51.280]   You know, whenever we see pictures of Jesus, we see him with, you know, like a glow on
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:57.040]   his face and he's got children sitting on his lap and he's just a happy-go-lucky guy,
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.040]   right?
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:03.000]   It's like, oh, if you see a man like that, man, I want to be beneath that guy because
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.320]   that person is very inviting.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.960]   He says he was despised and forsaken, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:15.480]   You ever see anybody who is sorrowful and acquainted with grief?
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.440]   Like I mean, we're not just talking about they just experienced something.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.720]   We're talking about their life is filled with grief.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.600]   You ever see somebody whose life was just that difficult?
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:28.160]   Yeah, they're not attractive.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.360]   They got a scowl on their face constantly.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:37.600]   You know, I remember years ago I went to Romania and a lot of these guys work on the farm literally
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:46.200]   10, 15, 16, 17 hours a day and they would come for some medical advice and so we had
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.400]   a different camp coming and we were sitting and interviewed them and I would ask them,
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.040]   how old are you?
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:59.680]   And they would tell me their age and I was shocked because in my mind they were 70, 75
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.280]   years old and some of these guys were my age.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.560]   And obviously, you know, I didn't say what happened to you?
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.680]   You know, like I know what happened.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.080]   They had a hard life.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.440]   They had a very difficult life.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.240]   So they aged.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:29.760]   So he said in every way, a human leader, whether political, Jesus would have been disqualified.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.320]   You would think maybe God, you know, made a mistake.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.720]   Obviously, that would be blasphemy.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.280]   Why did Jesus come in that form?
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:46.560]   He could have easily, with no effort, made him an attractive man, made him an inviting
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.960]   man, an articulate man.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:54.360]   How hard would it have been for Jesus to be born in the household of Caesar?
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.240]   Would have been nothing for him.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.600]   How hard would it have been for Jesus to be a muscular, tall, handsome, articulate, where
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.360]   everybody would want him as your leader?
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:09.840]   Why did he make him the exact opposite?
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:18.680]   For the same reason why God was angry with Israel when they asked and demanded a king.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:25.280]   You want to follow a man, but I am your king.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:32.760]   The whole sinfulness of man is they'd rather worship a creation in their image.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.320]   So they want to follow a man, a better version of themself.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.960]   That's what they want.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.840]   That's what mankind wants in a leader.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.000]   Somebody like me, but better.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.240]   That's the idolatry in our own hearts.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.120]   Jesus came to abolish all of that.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:35:00.160]   The very desire that you have, even when you think it's good, is in the context of rebellion
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.320]   against God.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:08.320]   And that's why he says his kingdom, his tabernacle is not of this earth.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:13.920]   That's why in Colossians chapter 3, 2-4, it says, "Set your mind on things above, not
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.160]   on the things that are on earth, for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.520]   God.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.320]   When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.320]   glory."
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:29.440]   The first step of eternal life is dying to ourselves.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:36.440]   The first step of meeting Christ and living a new life is dying to ourselves.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.440]   That's why when we get baptized, we say, "You are being buried with Christ."
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.440]   That's the first step.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.440]   And that's what repentance is.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.440]   Repentance isn't, "Oh, I had some lust.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.440]   I did this and I did this."
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.440]   No.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:53.440]   The first act of repentance is repentance over who I am.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.440]   My very nature is tainted, so my mind is tainted.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.440]   My emotions are tainted.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.440]   What makes me happy is tainted.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.440]   What gives me hope is tainted.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.440]   What I think is right is tainted.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.440]   What I think is wrong is tainted.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.440]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:19.440]   So the first thing that he tells us in eternal life is that we recognize the deepest part
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.440]   of who I am has been tainted by sin.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.440]   And that's what he is trying to deliver us from.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.440]   Not simply the consequence of sin, but the power of sin.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.440]   And that's why he says the last enemy is death.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:42.440]   That's why he says, "He who finds his life shall lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake shall find it."
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:47.440]   In our pursuit of justice, are we trying to find life on our own terms?
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.440]   Is Christ being exalted?
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:58.440]   And then he says, Hebrews chapter 8, 5, "Who serve a copy in the shadow of the heavenly things,
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:02.440]   just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle."
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:08.440]   See how he says, "That you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain."
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:14.440]   So he says, not only is it heaven, the whole point of the tabernacle is to reflect what Moses saw at the mountain.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.440]   Right? So let me ask you.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:21.440]   When he says the tabernacle was made in the pattern of what Moses saw,
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.440]   did Moses see a miniature version of the tabernacle? Is that what he saw?
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.440]   Is that what that means?
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.440]   Like, make it in the pattern that you saw.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.440]   You know how, like, you meet architect students who are studying,
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.440]   and they would make a little architectural building. You ever see that?
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:43.440]   Right? And it looks like, or maybe you are an architect, and you make a physical building
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:48.440]   to present to your client so that they can physically see, this is what we are going to build.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.440]   Right? Is that what he means?
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:58.440]   That Moses saw a miniature version of the tabernacle to go back and build it exactly?
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.440]   I mean, Moses must have had some fantastic memory.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.440]   Because he had, you know, he had the measurements to the T.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.440]   Is that what he saw? Is that what he means by pattern?
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.440]   I don't think so. I don't think he saw a miniature version of the tabernacle
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:18.440]   and God said, "Make sure you make it perfectly or you die."
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.440]   I don't think that's what happened.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:27.440]   In fact, when he goes up to the mountain, there's only one thing that the Bible records that he saw.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:31.440]   Do you remember what that was?
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:36.440]   God's glory. That's what he saw. Remember?
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:41.440]   So, God's glory made such an impression on him,
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:46.440]   that even just a reflection of that, people saw that you saw God's glory.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.440]   And they were terrified.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:54.440]   So, it doesn't spell it out, but when you put two and two together,
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:39:00.440]   he's not making a copy of a miniature version of the tabernacle that he saw and then making it.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:05.440]   What he saw was an impression of his glory, what made such an impact on him.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:10.440]   The tabernacle was to represent God's glory.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.440]   So, what did the tabernacle teach?
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   First and foremost, that God is holy.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.440]   And that sinful man cannot approach him in his natural state. That's the first thing.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.440]   And this is the thing that people don't understand.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:31.440]   The tabernacle existed at the center of the Israelite community.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:35.440]   And people may think, "Oh, it would have been great to have the tabernacle there."
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.440]   Wouldn't it have been awesome if the Ark of the Covenant was in the middle of the camp?
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.440]   Are you kidding?
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:52.440]   Aaron had to wear a bell, just in case he died, going into the Holy of Holies.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:40:00.440]   The first offering that was given, the two of his sons are consumed by fire.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:09.440]   Do you think having that tabernacle in the middle of the camp had warm, fuzzy feelings?
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:14.440]   My guess is they were terrified.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:19.440]   Can you imagine a mother with a small child and the child not understanding what's going on,
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:23.440]   started running into the tabernacle?
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.440]   You think the mother would have been, "Ah, you know, let him play a little bit."
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:30.440]   You know, free babysitting. Maybe the priest will watch him.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:36.440]   My guess is they were more terrified of a child wandering into the tabernacle
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:42.440]   than a mother would be afraid of a toddler walking on the freeway.
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:50.440]   The tabernacle was terrifying because it was constantly taught, "You cannot come.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.440]   You cannot come. There's no seat there."
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.440]   There were reasons why these animals were being slaughtered all day long.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:04.440]   Every time they saw a barbecue, they didn't smell the barbecue and say, "Oh, that smells good."
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:10.440]   That barbecue reminded them that there is no atonement for sin until there is death,
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:14.440]   until there's shedding of blood. It was a very bloody scene.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:19.440]   There was constantly blood flowing from the tabernacle.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:26.440]   So the first thing that Moses recognized when he saw God's glory was terror.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.440]   And that's what that tabernacle represented.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:33.440]   You cannot come to this holy God nonchalantly.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.440]   And that man is utterly sinful.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.440]   That you cannot appease God by your strength.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:43.440]   God did not require that we be good.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.440]   God required perfection.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:50.440]   Perfection. It wasn't enough to say, "Oh, that's not what I meant.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:57.440]   Oh, I did 99 percent." No, He required perfection.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:03.440]   So imagine that if you're an Israelite, that at the center of your camp.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:07.440]   And God told Moses to build this in the pattern that you saw,
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:13.440]   with the impression that you got when you saw my glory, build that in that pattern.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.440]   And that's what he built.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:24.440]   As he was terrified, as he was terrified by the glory of God,
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:29.440]   the people of God were terrified by God's presence.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.440]   And it was necessary for them to be terrified.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.440]   For them to understand where they stood,
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:41.440]   and the danger that they were in if they didn't take this seriously.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.440]   The constant nature of the sacrifices.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.440]   That no matter how great, no matter how well-meaning,
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.440]   no matter how much sacrifice you made on Monday,
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.440]   you had to sacrifice again on Tuesday, and then on Wednesday.
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.440]   No matter how great a celebration of Day of Atonement,
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.440]   next year you had to do it again.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:02.440]   So the constant nature for the need of sacrifices reminded the people,
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:10.440]   no matter how much you sacrifice, you will continue to need sacrifices.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.440]   You will never wash away this sin.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.440]   Tomorrow you will have to do it again, and the next day you will have to do it again.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.440]   And even the ones who were making the sacrifices were limited by their own sin,
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.440]   and their finiteness.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:28.440]   Which pointed to the fact that none of this was going to get them to God.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.440]   None of this was going to get them to God.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.440]   That's what he was patterning.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.440]   That's what he was trying to point out.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:41.440]   And it is that tabernacle, the heavenly tabernacle, that all of that pointed to,
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:47.440]   the end conclusion of all of this was, only one man can sit on that throne.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:57.440]   Only one man, and only one sacrifice, is perfect enough to satisfy the wrath of God.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:02.440]   That's what that tabernacle was for.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:07.440]   And it is that tabernacle, it is that heavenly throne, where he says he sat down
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:12.440]   at the right hand of the throne of majesty in heaven.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:17.440]   And because of that, he says, he has a more excellent minister.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:23.440]   He has a better mediator, a better covenant, with a better promise.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:26.440]   Now what is the application of all of this for Christians today?
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:32.440]   Instead of not just like, oh, that's great.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:45.440]   Anything that you and I endeavor, anything, getting married, having children,
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:55.440]   starting a business, getting a college degree, getting a job,
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:05.440]   anything that we endeavor in that doesn't exalt Christ first is under the judgment of God.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:11.440]   It's under the judgment of God, no matter how wildly you succeed.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:17.440]   No matter how wildly you succeed in the eyes of the world,
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:22.440]   at the end of the day, it is under the judgment of God.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:28.440]   You cannot appease the wrath of God by human effort.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.440]   You cannot.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.440]   That's what the tabernacle taught.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.440]   That's what the sacrifices reminded us of.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:44.440]   And that's why, first and foremost, we must come to Christ.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.440]   First and foremost, we must come to Christ.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:51.440]   It doesn't matter if you create a perfect government.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.440]   It doesn't matter if we have the greatest economy.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:59.440]   It doesn't matter if we have the greatest leader, the greatest laws, the greatest movement.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.440]   It doesn't matter.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:09.440]   At the end of the day, if Christ isn't exalted, all of that is still under the judgment of God.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:17.440]   That's why the end conclusion of all of this is to fix our eyes upon Christ, to be anchored in Christ.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:24.440]   No matter how well-meaning we are, no matter how well-intended we are, is Christ first.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:29.440]   So let me conclude with this, with practical application, with what's going on around us.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.440]   And I know there's a lot of conversations right now.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.440]   Should we not care about what's going on?
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.440]   Of course we should care.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.440]   Of course we should care.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:45.440]   We should care about poverty.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:51.440]   We should care about sex trafficking.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.440]   We should care about injustice.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.440]   We should care about division.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.440]   We should care about the racial injustice.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.440]   We should care about all of these things.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:07.440]   And you and I live in a free country where we have the ability to speak, ability to vote.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:12.440]   We're not living in suppression from the government for the most part.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:18.440]   So the call to the gospel ministry is not a call to be passive.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:24.440]   Because the indicatives of what the gospel teaches always leads to "therefore."
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.440]   Therefore.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:32.440]   If we believe in all of this, therefore our life should reflect that love.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:39.440]   But it must always begin with Christ.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:44.440]   If you say, "Is that all we're going to do?"
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.440]   And then you've never done it.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.440]   And that's why we need to start.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:56.440]   If you've never shared the gospel, and you're complaining, "All we're going to do is share the gospel."
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.440]   No. We're not only going to share the gospel.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.440]   But if you've never shared the gospel, that's the first thing that the churches need to start.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:08.440]   If you have a church filled with people who've never shared the gospel, and then you say, "All we're going to share is the gospel."
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:12.440]   No. You have to first share the gospel.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.440]   And in my opinion, that's our biggest problem right now.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.440]   It's not that we're not getting involved, or we're not doing this, or we're not doing that.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:24.440]   For the most part, most churches are sick. They're not healthy.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:30.440]   They're not living up to what the Bible has already plainly stated in the scripture.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:38.440]   And you can't organize a sick church to make the society healthy.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:42.440]   So our priority is to make the church healthy.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:48.440]   But the reason why we need to make the church healthy is when you have a healthy church,
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:52.440]   we can help a sick world.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:57.440]   But you don't recruit sick people to help sick people.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.440]   That's why we preach the gospel.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.440]   That's why we preach the gospel first.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:07.440]   Because until people are regenerated and meet Christ,
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.440]   until the work of God is working powerfully in our hearts,
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:19.440]   anything else we do in our power, in our own might, is always going to end in frustration and failure.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:25.440]   So let me, again, if our praise team is here, if I can ask you guys to come back up.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:31.440]   We're going to take just a minute as we prepare to pray.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:36.440]   And I'm going to ask you to take just a few minutes to pray before they lead us into our next worship.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.440]   And if you could just begin us.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.440]   I'm really asking you guys, because there are so many voices,
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.440]   and maybe some of you guys just haven't been paying attention.
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.440]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.440]   That's fine.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.440]   But if that's not you, and you're hearing all these voices,
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.440]   you're being pulled left and right, and you don't know where to stand,
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:02.440]   and you have compassion, which is great, you want to do something,
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:09.440]   but at the same time the voices are so strong on either side, you're confused.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.440]   Don't go from that confusion and just make a leap.
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:18.440]   The Bible says if you lack wisdom to come to God, right,
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:23.440]   He will give you without finding fault, meaning first and foremost He invites us to himself.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:29.440]   So right now, again, like I said, if there's any time where the church needs to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.440]   it's right now.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.440]   So I want to invite you to take a few minutes to pray.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.440]   Ask God to start with you.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:43.440]   Before the society, before the injustice and all this, start with you.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.440]   Where are you with Christ right now?
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:50.440]   And I know the pandemic has caused us to kind of -- a lot of people have drifted in their faith.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:53.440]   Maybe that's you, that you haven't really been paying attention,
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:58.440]   and the first emotions that you felt with, like, I've got to do something,
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:02.440]   well, I want to invite you first and foremost to come before the Lord.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.440]   Ask the Lord to search your heart.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.440]   Where are you?
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:09.440]   If you're not walking right with God, it's been a long time since you spent meaningful time in prayer.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.440]   It's been a while since you really diligently searched the Scriptures.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.440]   Before you worry about anything else, first come before God.
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:21.440]   Ask God to bring you to him first.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:25.440]   And so let's take some time to pray again, and after we do that, our worship team will lead us.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:32.440]   So let me pray for us, and then I'm going to ask you guys to continue to be in that prayer as they lead us.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:38.440]   Heavenly Father, we want to lift up our church, lift up ourselves first and foremost, Lord God,
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.440]   that you would examine our hearts.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:47.440]   Especially now, Lord, as we live in very volatile and confusing times,
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.440]   help us, Lord, to truly be anchored in Christ.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:59.440]   That before we listen to any voices around us, teach us, Lord God, to search your word,
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:07.440]   to examine if anything that has been said even this morning, that if this truly is from you.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:12.440]   I pray, Father God, that your grace would be sufficient, that your children would hear your voice
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.440]   and follow you and you alone.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.440]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
