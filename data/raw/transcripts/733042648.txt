[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.760]   If you can turn your Bibles to Luke chapter 2, and we will be looking at verses 21 through
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.960]   38, but I'm just going to be reading the first four verses for the sake of time.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.220]   Again I encourage you as I put up the passage that we're going to be going over on Saturday
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.240]   afternoon and Saturday night, I just encourage you to at least take a look at it, look over
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.060]   the questions so that you'll know what we'll be covering and I think you'll be able to
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.000]   understand better because the text art we're looking at is not just two or three verses
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.480]   so it'll be easier if you kind of had some idea of what's going on in the text.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.040]   So I encourage you to do that Saturday before you come.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.560]   Luke chapter 2 verse 21 to 24, "And when eight days had passed before his circumcision, his
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.200]   name was then called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.400]   womb.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.840]   And when the days for their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.560]   him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.680]   As it is written in the law of the Lord, every firstborn male that opens the womb shall be
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.560]   called holy to the Lord and to offer a sacrifice according to what was said in the law of the
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.920]   Lord, a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons."
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.120]   Let's pray.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.920]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.920]   We pray that you would guide us and lead us and lead us into a deeper understanding of
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.440]   why these holy scriptures have these events and things, Lord God, in here for us.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.680]   Help us to glean what you have intended and to mold our hearts, our thoughts, our hopes
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.920]   completely upon your desires and upon Christ.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.040]   I think we all know that whatever it is that you are coveting changes how you behave and
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.600]   how you live and how you spend your money.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.880]   It kind of shows what we long for, what we value.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:13.280]   If you are waiting for something that's important, you will adjust your life, spending, habits
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.800]   so that you can eagerly wait for that.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.760]   If you have a trip in mind that you really, really desire to go, you're saving money,
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.360]   maybe you're saving points, looking at airlines and hotels and saving up your vacation time
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.200]   and planning for whatever needs to be taken care of so that you can be gone for that period.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.120]   Whatever we have in our hearts that we're longing for, it changes our behavior, changes
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.640]   how we spend money, changes how we spend our time.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.720]   We go through different phases of this when we're young.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.040]   Maybe a toy or something promised at Christmas.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.040]   We get older, we want to get our driver's license or get a car because it means freedom
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.040]   for us.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.640]   Then you get obsessed about that or you want a certain job or maybe you want to get married,
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.760]   maybe you're praying to have children.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.080]   Whatever it is, it causes you to change your behavior because whatever is in our heart
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.160]   eventually gets played out in our life.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.480]   When I was thinking about this, it automatically took me back before I met Christ.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.400]   Me and my friends, we decided that we want to make the baseball team at Burbank High
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.000]   School.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.160]   We spent a whole year practicing.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160]   I wanted to be an outfielder.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.880]   I had a friend who wanted to be a catcher.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.560]   We had another guy who wanted to shortstop.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.560]   We all took turns.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.040]   If it was my turn to practice, I would stand outside and these guys would hit me like a
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.800]   thousand balls just outside.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.120]   I would learn to chase it down.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.600]   They would deliberately hit it far from me so I would see how much distance I can cover.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.320]   Probably the same shot, thousands of times that summer.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.320]   Then it was time for shortstop and we would just take turns just hitting it as hard as
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.160]   we can in different places.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.000]   The guy who was trying out for shortstop would run and try to get it and see how much space
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   he can cover.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.080]   Our catcher, he was there.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.280]   We just threw it in the ground, threw it on the side, threw it as hard as we could and
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.680]   see how much of space he could cover, what kind of balls that he can catch.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.680]   We probably spent that whole year, every opportunity we got, we got out in the Burbank baseball
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.400]   field because that's where the tryouts would be.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.280]   Probably at least a year, maybe more than that, just preparing ourselves to join this
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.200]   baseball team.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.600]   As I mentioned before, right in the middle of that tryout, I ended up going to a retreat
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   and I became a Christian.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.640]   You just completely, it's not that I lost interest in baseball.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.960]   It's just what I coveted, I coveted more to be able to be at that Bible study that they
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.080]   were having on Friday than I did baseball.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.680]   All of a sudden, all that time and effort that I spent to try to get on this team, it
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.560]   just didn't seem as important.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.800]   I just didn't want to miss what was happening on Friday nights and the prayer meetings that
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.800]   they had.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.160]   Again, I share all that because that's the first thing I think of.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:08.440]   What is something that I poured all my energy and thought and because I wanted that so bad
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.400]   and I can't think of anything else that I put that kind of devotion to.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.560]   And then to have it just instantaneously, my value changed overnight when I met Christ.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.360]   I know a lot of you, and I'm not saying there's anything bad, innately wrong about baseball
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.960]   itself, it's just that I just put so much time and effort to prepare for that.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.560]   All of a sudden, it just didn't seem as important.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.960]   It just seemed like a silly game, whether I made the team or not made the team.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.400]   I'm not sure if I would have made the team because the Burbank High School baseball team
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.080]   was a really good baseball team at that time.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.160]   And among my friends, the catcher made the team.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.360]   And he was good enough where he was in the varsity when he was in 10th grade.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.160]   And so we kind of lived our life vicariously through him.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.840]   So I'm not sure if I would have made the team anyway, but I just remember very vividly when
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.560]   my heart and my desire changed, how much that changed the trajectory of what was important,
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.560]   what wasn't important.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.160]   I say all of this because as Christians, we are to eagerly wait and long for the coming
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.280]   of Christ more than anything else.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.880]   And from time to time, we have to ask ourselves, how much of our longing for Christ is affecting
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.040]   your daily life today?
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.960]   Now I know you're here at church on Sunday.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.000]   I know you're participating in Bible study and maybe you're a faithful giver, but the
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.760]   question goes beyond just a superficial, how much of your longing for the second coming
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.480]   of Christ actually affects the career decision that you're making?
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.540]   How does it affect the person that you may be dating?
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.760]   How does it affect the person that you may marry?
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.000]   What you do with your finance?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.120]   What do you do on vacation?
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.340]   Like how does it affect the way you raise your children?
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.080]   Or is that somehow compartmentalized where you see secular and then religious and you
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.000]   kind of live two separate lives?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.600]   Whatever is in your heart, truly in your heart that you really covet, whether we like it
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.900]   or not, it affects our life.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.840]   How you spend your money, I think there's a good indicator of how you spend your money,
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:24.360]   how you spend your time, is a good indicator of what's in your heart.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.640]   Now I say all of this because there's two people that are mentioned in the birth and
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.200]   the early years of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.320]   Simeon and Anna is mentioned to us, the two people who eagerly waited all their life of
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.400]   the coming of Christ.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.160]   Now there was no guarantee when they were eagerly waiting for him that Christ was going
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.160]   to come.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:49.000]   And yet they knew that the answer to whatever suffering of Israel or whatever longing that
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.540]   they had in their own heart, that Christ would be the answer.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.760]   So the scripture tells us that Simeon, as he is introduced to us in verse 25, there
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.560]   was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and this man was righteous man and devout,
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.200]   looking for the consolation of Israel.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.360]   Looking, the word looking isn't simply just watching to see, "Hey, is he going to come
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.360]   or not?"
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:16.920]   It means to eagerly search that this was consuming in his heart.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:22.360]   And the reason why we know that this was consuming, as soon as he meets the infant Christ, he
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.320]   recognizes that that's the Messiah.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.640]   That's the one he's been praying for.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.400]   That's what he's been eagerly waiting for.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.240]   And so he responds in verse 29, says, "Now Lord, you are releasing your bond servant
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.880]   to depart in peace according to your word."
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:43.800]   In other words, everything that he desired and coveted so much in the coming of Christ,
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.280]   desired for Christ to come.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.040]   And as soon as he sees him, he says, "Everything that I want in life is done.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.960]   Now I can go to the Lord."
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.960]   He's lived a full life.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:56.720]   There's nothing that he is longing for anymore because that was at the core of his desire.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.280]   We see Job do the same thing.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.160]   Remember all of his life, right?
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.240]   Because he's a righteous man, he suffers and he's asking God, "Where are you?
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.640]   How come you are allowing this to happen?"
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.960]   And then God shows up.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.960]   And then remember what Job says?
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.680]   You know, up to this point, "I've heard of you from a distance, but now I see you face
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.680]   to face."
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.160]   Now he can go in peace.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.140]   That's exactly what Job says.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.920]   His greatest longing, he realized, was meeting God.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.560]   And that's exactly what Simeon says.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.680]   He was longing, looking for the coming of the Messiah.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.400]   Now that he's here, he says, "Now I can depart in peace."
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.000]   When our heart is not fixated upon Christ, we have a tendency.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.640]   It's like, "Yeah, Christ is going to come."
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.560]   And that's a theological truth.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.240]   It's a theological truth that this is what Christians believe, this is what the Bible
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.040]   says, but it's not the reality of our life.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.860]   I think many of us would be, if we're honest enough, we'll confess, if you have something
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:58.560]   that you have planned in the next year or you're coveting something, maybe your promotion's
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.980]   coming up or maybe you're preparing for a wedding or maybe you have this great trip
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.820]   that you've been saving up for.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.400]   If I told you that Christ was coming tomorrow, maybe in our hearts, we say, "Wait, can you
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.320]   wait a month?
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.080]   I want to experience marriage.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.080]   Can you wait a month?
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.080]   Because I want to take this trip.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:20.020]   And if I go to Machu Picchu, then I could die in peace."
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.840]   If our heart is coveting anything else besides Christ, the coming of Christ will actually
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.660]   seem like an interference of what we're longing for.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.660]   He's actually getting into it.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.640]   It's something like, "Well, not yet, not yet, because we have this.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.360]   We have this set up.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.360]   And so I've been longing.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.800]   I put so much time and effort into this.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.000]   Would you just wait a month?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.080]   Would you wait six months?"
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:49.120]   Simeon is mentioned here outside of the fact that he was just a random guy.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.880]   I mean, he doesn't play any significant role.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.360]   We understand why Elizabeth and Zacharias and Mary and Joseph is in this story, right?
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.200]   Because they're mothers and fathers of two significant people.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:08.960]   But the only reason why Simeon is even mentioned here is because God answered his prayer.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.160]   That's it.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.120]   There's no other significant – he's not mentioned in any prophecies, right?
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.400]   He doesn't play any specific role.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.760]   If Simeon is never mentioned in this story, it would have no significant change in the
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.600]   narrative of Jesus' birth and what he did.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.160]   Only reason why he's there is as an example for us, for our own longing.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:36.320]   That even though this was God-ordained, God had promised this, he tells us God fulfilled
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:42.520]   his own promise, his own covenant through the fervent watching and looking of this righteous
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.520]   man.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.200]   You know, sometimes we wrestle with God's sovereignty and man's responsibility and
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.000]   say, "Well, if God is sovereign, what does it matter if we pray?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.120]   If God is sovereign, why do we need to be righteous?"
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.080]   He's going to fulfill his promise anyways.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.600]   But it tells us here that though this was God's plan and everything is happening according
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:07.400]   to God's plan, he tells us that this was also in response to this man's fervent seeking
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.420]   and looking and praying.
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.400]   We don't know how this works, but we know that the Bible clearly tells us that this
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.560]   is how things unfold.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:23.000]   Another lady named Anna, who's 84 years old, tells us that she was married for seven years
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.120]   and then her husband passes away and she never marries.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:33.080]   And she devotes herself to prayer and fasting until she's 84 years old, waiting for the
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.520]   redemption of Israel, in other words, the Messiah to come.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:42.040]   You know, whenever I read this story, it reminds me of this old lady that I remember when I
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.480]   was in my early 30s when I was teaching ESL to Korean elderly.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.440]   There was this one lady in her late 70s, right?
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:55.200]   She would come into class almost every single morning and say, "Oh, I guess I didn't die
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.200]   another day.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.320]   The Lord did not take me."
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.080]   And as a young man, it sounded pretty morbid.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.440]   Like every day she would walk in, "Oh, another day."
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.320]   And then she would sit there and say, "Clearly she's a committed Christian," because she
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.920]   would always bring her Bible, open it up and read it in between break.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.000]   And I said, "Why do you keep saying that?"
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.040]   So one day I decided to ask her.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.960]   You know, it's kind of curious.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.800]   Like every day you're like eager to die, right?
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.760]   So she told me her story, what happened.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:33.920]   She said she was married right before the Korean War broke out.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.600]   And so she was only married a few months.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.600]   And during her honeymoon stage, when the North Korean soldiers came to the South and forcefully
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.480]   recruited her husband into the North Korean army, which happened to a lot of South Korean
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.600]   young men at that time.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   And so she lost her husband and she never knew what happened.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.320]   She just assumed that he died in the war.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.880]   And after a couple of months of that, she said she never remarried.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:04.440]   And she said she just stayed as a widow and she devoted herself to serve the Lord.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:10.040]   And then all day long, when I knew her, all she did was copy the Korean Bible, right?
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.720]   By hand, every day, that was her.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.000]   She would finish the classroom, learn probably the same lesson.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.440]   I taught the same lesson every year for four years, right?
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.480]   And she would learn the same lesson every week, but in between times she would just
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.480]   copy the Bible.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.440]   And she told me that she was almost done with the Bible.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.200]   And then when she is done, she repeats it over and over again.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.680]   And she literally is waiting for her to go to the Lord.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.840]   Every time I read the story of Anna, it reminds me of that lady because this lady, one, was
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:44.620]   eagerly waiting to be reunited with her husband that she lost when she was young.
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:49.480]   But along with that, she spent all her life devoted to serve the Lord.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:56.920]   So I can see why she is eagerly waiting, because she didn't see death as an end to life.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:02.780]   She saw death as an opportunity to get to the place that she really wanted to go to.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.360]   It says Anna, when she lost her husband, she lived the rest of her life until she was 84
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.960]   years old at the temple.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:14.200]   And all she did was devote herself to prayer and to fasting, waiting for the redemption
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.240]   of Israel to come, for the Messiah to come.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.240]   It is not by accident that Simeon and Anna is in the Bible.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:28.280]   It's not just random people that just kind of threw in there for no reason.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:33.100]   They're in there because their faithful prayer, even though they seem insignificant in this
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:39.480]   redemptive timeline, we're told that because of their prayer, because of their longing,
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.880]   God answers their prayer.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.600]   Now, what specifically were they longing for?
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.360]   Anna says that she was praying for the redemption of Israel to appear.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:57.000]   Simeon specifically says that he was waiting for the consolation of Israel.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Consolation.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.320]   You know, in English, when we say consolation, we often think of game shows that if you don't
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.160]   win, you get the consolation prize.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.160]   Right?
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.400]   So it's a runner up prize.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.400]   That's consolation.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:14.240]   Well, the word consolation basically means the one who consoles, the one who encourages,
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.920]   the one who comforts.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:24.040]   So it's interesting here because prior to chapter 2, 21, we've been introduced to the
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.000]   Son of God.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.240]   We were introduced to the rightful King of Israel, the Savior.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:38.160]   But here it says Simeon was longing, looking for the consolation of Israel to come.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.160]   Consolation.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.160]   The one who's going to comfort.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.000]   Now, that's an interesting way to describe the Son of God.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Right?
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   The one who's going to come to console.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.140]   What is he coming to console?
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.880]   What was the position of Israel?
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.600]   Was he consoling them because they were under oppression of their enemies?
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.520]   Were they consoling them because economic trials?
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.080]   Were they consoling them because they were having hardships of life?
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:09.200]   What is it exactly that the Messiah is going to come and to console and to encourage?
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   Well, Paul describes our salvation with the same term, that word consoling.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.520]   And so as he writes 2 Corinthians, the beginning of that letter, 2 Corinthians, he basically
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.040]   describes salvation.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.360]   And listen to the way he describes salvation.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:36.720]   of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we will be able to comfort
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:42.080]   those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.760]   For just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.480]   through Christ.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.600]   But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation, or if we are comforted, it
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.280]   is for your comfort, which is effective in the patient enduring of the same suffering
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.760]   which we also suffer.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.200]   And our hope for you is firmly grounded, knowing that as you are sharers of our suffering,
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.280]   so also you are sharers of our comfort.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:13.240]   In those four verses, he mentions the word comfort ten separate times.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:18.000]   And the reason why this is significant, he's just describing our salvation.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.600]   He says, "God of all comfort, who has comforted us in order that with the comfort that we
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:28.640]   have received with him, that we will be able to give comfort to other people."
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:34.520]   He's not simply talking about comfort as in, you know, you have trials, hardship, or
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:40.960]   you're hurt, or maybe you're having marriage problems, and so Christ comes to comfort you.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:46.760]   It may be true that that is also comforting, but the comforting he is describing is our
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.440]   salvation itself.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.180]   The one who will save.
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:57.200]   And another way to describe that is describing comfort, right?
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:04.200]   Now those who don't feel the need for a Savior, cannot understand what he means by
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   comfort.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.440]   Like Jesus saves us, he forgives us, right?
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:15.200]   He gives us hope, he gives us power by the Holy Spirit, but is he actually our comfort?
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:20.900]   When's the last time you viewed your salvation as being comforted?
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.360]   But that's exactly how the Bible describes it.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.160]   In Isaiah chapter 41 through 4, "Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.320]   Speak kindly to Jerusalem and call out to her that her warfare has ended."
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.120]   He's describing that because of their sins, they fell into captivity.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:41.240]   Babylonians are going to come and destroy your nation, and as a result of your sin,
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.400]   judgment is coming.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.600]   But at the end of that, he says, "I will not forget you.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.360]   You are the apple of my eye."
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.800]   And then he describes a restoration that's going to come when the Messiah comes, and
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:57.000]   he says, "Comfort, comfort, says our Lord, comfort."
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.960]   Why does he describe our salvation as comfort?
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.760]   And again, let me ask you, when was the last time you've considered the forgiveness of
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.920]   your sins as comforting?
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.080]   God bringing comfort.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.360]   Isaiah 49 verse 13 says, "Shout for joy, O heavens, and rejoice, O earth.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.920]   Break forth into joyful shouting, O mountains, for the Lord has comforted his people and
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.120]   will have compassion on his afflicted."
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.600]   So what is the comfort, and what is the affliction?
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:35.680]   Is he simply talking about those who have been afflicted by their enemies, persecuted?
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:40.200]   Because of the Romans, because of the Persians, Babylonians, and Assyrians, that he's coming
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.260]   to comfort them, to deliver them?
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.760]   What does he mean by comfort?
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:53.480]   This is the distinction between somebody who recognizes what he has in Christ, who is longing
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:59.000]   for the coming of Christ, versus people who just see him as a figurehead.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   It's like a ticket.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.200]   I don't want to go to hell.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.720]   I believe just enough to make sure that I have the right ticket, and I confess the right
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.760]   thing so that when I die, that I won't go to hell and I go to heaven.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.640]   Meanwhile, in this life, I'm going to try to get as much as I can, just like everybody
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.880]   else in the world, and then when I die, just as I had a good life here, I want to make
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.800]   sure that I have a good eternity also.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:26.560]   The distinction between somebody who is genuinely longing for the coming of Christ is the one
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:32.240]   who recognizes the need for comfort.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.200]   Let me give you an example.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:40.440]   Have you ever tried to comfort somebody that just cannot be consoled?
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.280]   Think of a situation that maybe it was a friend or a family member or something that they
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.760]   were going through something horrible, and you try to console them and comfort them,
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.120]   and there are no words.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.760]   There's nothing you could possibly do.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:22:00.240]   Now, again, being in ministry through the years, there's been many situations where
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:06.400]   we try to, "Here's what the Bible says," and we try to come around, encourage them,
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.400]   deliver food.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:12.680]   I'm encouraged that we have a food team in our church when people are going through trials.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.000]   We send food just to let them know we're there.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.480]   But there's a kind of suffering and pain that no amount of human comfort, no amount of words,
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.840]   no amount of encouragement would get you out of that.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:36.200]   I've been in situations, many of you guys know, the young families who lose their child.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:42.360]   There's no amount of words, no amount of money that can be given, no amount of community
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.600]   can take away that pain.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:53.560]   With many of you guys, counsel so many people who have been abused growing up, sometimes
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:59.360]   by people that they trusted, and no amount of counseling.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.940]   There's no passage that I can open up.
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.680]   No amount of love you can pour upon them is enough.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.800]   You can't just turn that off, and that pain is there for the rest of their lives.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:14.360]   I remember as a young pastor trying to figure out, "Maybe I need to learn how to do counseling
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.360]   better.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.360]   Maybe there's some words.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.120]   Maybe there's a book that I can read, and I could be a better comforter."
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:30.680]   And I realized through time and through frustration that there are some situations that maybe
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.880]   some of you have experienced.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.600]   There are some situations that maybe people around you, that you realize that you are
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.280]   completely helpless.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:46.200]   The reality is you are helpless, because we do not have the ability.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:53.840]   And at the end of the day, the hope of the gospel is, the only comfort that can be given,
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:59.560]   is that one day Christ is going to come, and He's going to make all things new.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:06.280]   Whatever was broken, whatever heartache, whatever hardship, whatever excruciating pain that
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:14.960]   you may go through because of your sin, and because of being in a sinful and fallen world.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.800]   The only true comfort is when the Comforter comes.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.400]   When we meet the Comforter.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.640]   And no matter how broken this world is, no matter how broken our relationship, no matter
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:31.240]   how broken our families, that when the Comforter comes, that He and He alone can make all things
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.800]   new.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.840]   And that's what He means, the Comforter.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.320]   Simeon was waiting for the Comforter, because he recognized that only the Messiah.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.640]   He wasn't looking for friends.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.080]   He wasn't looking for anybody else.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:51.360]   Because he recognized that only the Messiah can fulfill this longing in a sinner's heart.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.880]   See, there's one thing that you and I cannot do.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.800]   Our own sins.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:07.360]   The damage that you've done because of your flesh cannot be reversed simply by adding
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.080]   good works.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.960]   You can't break something and then say, "You know, I'm going to make this better by putting
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.240]   glue and then making it look okay."
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:25.400]   See, every sinner, when he recognizes his sins and the damage of the sin, it puts us
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.240]   in a place where we are desperate.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:34.320]   No amount of hard work, no amount of hearing sermons, no amount of counseling, no amount
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.800]   of comfort that you hear from other people.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:45.160]   Only Christ and Christ alone can take that burden upon Himself.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.320]   And that's why Simeon wasn't simply waiting for the Messiah to come so that He can deliver
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:55.280]   us from this bondage of these foreign agents.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.800]   That's why the Scripture says, "Behold, the child is appointed for the fall and rise of
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.440]   many in Israel and for the sign to be opposed."
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:08.160]   Why is it the fall and the rise of Israel?
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:13.600]   The same gospels, the same hope that we have in Christ causes some to rise.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:18.240]   Rise meaning to have hope in Christ and then it would be the source of stumbling block
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.000]   and destruction for some.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.440]   There's a reason why the Bible says the cross is what?
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.280]   Foolishness to those who are perishing, but it is the power of God for those who are being
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.220]   saved.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:34.840]   If you, again every single one of us as sinners, we recognize that the poverty of our sins
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:40.080]   and we recognize the destructive nature of the sin, every single sinner is in a position
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:45.560]   before God in desperation that my only hope is Christ.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:50.480]   It's not better economy, it's not better friends, it's not if I find a better church or better
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.480]   situation.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.800]   My only hope is Christ.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:02.000]   So it causes me to go and to be anywhere that draws me closer to Christ.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.720]   That's the whole giving of the law.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.440]   The whole giving of the law is so that we can see sin as utterly sinful.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:14.000]   And once we recognize sin as utterly sinful and how desperate we are, we are put in the
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:22.440]   same position as Simeon, longing and eagerly waiting for the only one who can truly console
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.920]   us, to comfort us and to deliver us for him to come.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.120]   See that's why they're highlighted.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.440]   It's not because they were something special and they're more righteous than others, it's
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.880]   because of their longing.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.480]   God answers their prayer.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.280]   What would cause a rise and fall?
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:46.520]   You know what's interesting is I posted up last night, I said look at verses 21 all the
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.700]   way down to 29.
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.180]   What is the unifying theme, right?
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:55.860]   And hopefully some of you who looked at that, that you found what I was trying to get at,
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:56.940]   right?
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:02.820]   If you look at verse 21 to 29 repeatedly over and over again, there's a phrase, a similar
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:08.500]   phrase, maybe not exact wording, but in almost every verse that describes Jesus' birth and
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.900]   his childhood after circumcision, what does it say?
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:18.300]   According to the law, according to the law, as God commanded, as God commanded, according
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:21.180]   to the law, every single one of those verses.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:26.380]   Verse 21, he was circumcised on the eighth day according to the law that was given in
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.740]   Genesis chapter 17.
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:32.420]   Verse 22, and when the days for the purification according to the law of Moses was completed.
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:38.860]   Verse 23, as it is written in the law of the Lord, every firstborn male that opens the
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.700]   womb shall be called holy to the Lord.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:47.340]   Verse 24, and the offer of sacrifice according to what was said in the law of the Lord.
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.180]   Verse 27, and he came into the spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.900]   the child Jesus to carry out for him the custom of the law.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:00.420]   Verse 29, now the Lord you are releasing your bond servant to depart in peace according
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.580]   to your word.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:08.540]   So every part of the introduction of Jesus' childhood says everything was done according
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.540]   to the law.
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.540]   Now why was this important?
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:16.220]   What is Luke trying to convey by telling us that everything that was happening was happening
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.220]   according to the law?
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.740]   What was the purpose?
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:24.300]   One, his parents were righteous people and they were very faithful Jews who raised him
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.920]   according to the law.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.940]   But there's something more happening here.
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:35.760]   It's something more happening just pointing out the righteousness of the parents.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.860]   Why was this necessary to point out?
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.740]   Because of why Jesus came.
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:51.060]   The whole reason why Jesus came was to be a perfect sacrifice for our sins.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:56.420]   If Jesus disobeyed the law in any commandment, he would have been disqualified, even from
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.880]   birth.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.620]   So everything from the get-go, it says it was according to the law, according to the
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.160]   law, according to the law, according to the law.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:11.700]   Even as an infant, everything that God prescribed a faithful Jew to do, he said Jesus performed
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.900]   that perfectly, even through his parents.
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.740]   There's a reason why Jesus lives 30 years before he comes on the scene.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.740]   Why didn't he do it when he was 20?
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:23.020]   Why didn't he do it when he was 25?
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.980]   The reason why he waits until he's 30 years old, according to Levitical law, a priest
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:33.180]   was considered an intern until he turned to age 30, because they considered at 30 that
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.660]   you live long enough to serve on your own.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:41.380]   So prior to the age of 30, you would have to have a supervisor supervising you and then
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:48.060]   when you're able, as a full-grown adult at the age of 30, you were independently able
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.060]   to serve.
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:56.960]   So 30 was the marker that was given in the law where you've experienced the totality
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.960]   of life.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.820]   Obviously, there's people who live to 60, 70, but 30 was the marker where it's like
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:08.460]   now you're a full-grown adult, you've experienced, you've lived long enough to experience life.
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:14.180]   Jesus waits 30 years, because what was the 30 years for?
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:18.100]   To prove that he was sinless.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:23.560]   And you notice when Jesus comes to get baptized at the age of 30, to get baptized by John
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:27.160]   the Baptist, remember what John the Baptist says?
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.700]   Why am I baptizing you?
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:29.700]   You're greater than me.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.880]   My whole ministry is to prepare for you.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.880]   You should baptize me.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.880]   I should be baptizing you.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.640]   Remember what Jesus says?
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.980]   To fulfill all righteousness.
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:44.340]   To be obedient to everything that God has established.
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.380]   And then right after he gets baptized, what happens?
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.540]   He gets led into the wilderness and what happens to him?
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:53.620]   He gets tested by the devil for 40 days and 40 nights.
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.500]   Why is he being tested?
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:03.340]   Because everything that he was doing was proving ground of his worthiness to be a perfect sacrifice
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.740]   for our sins.
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:11.220]   So even from his birth, every part of what he has experienced, even through his parents,
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:17.440]   he was completely obedient, perfect substitution for our sins.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.480]   In Hebrews 4.15 he says, "For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:28.140]   weaknesses but one who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin."
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.600]   Everything Christ did was proving ground.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.040]   If he disobeyed any of this, he would have been disqualified.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:40.300]   If he failed in any of his testing, if for 30 some years that he lived and he broke any
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.840]   commandment of God, everything that he came to do would have been disqualified because
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:48.180]   he would no longer be perfect.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:52.740]   Hebrews 2.17, "Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in all things so that he
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.840]   might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the things pertaining to God to
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:01.240]   make propitiation for the sins of the people."
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:05.940]   And again in 2 Corinthians 5.21, "He made him who knew no sin to be sin in our behalf
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:10.340]   so that we might become the righteousness of God in him."
[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.480]   We read Jesus' infinite count, right?
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:19.260]   Now I know many of you guys have children that are young.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:23.620]   And when we go to your birthdays or you know, hundred day celebration, it's usually a huge
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.780]   celebration, right?
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.240]   What's the potential of this child?
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.680]   What is he going to grow up to be?
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.680]   When is he going to read?
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.000]   When is he going to walk?
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:40.280]   Naturally there's life and hope that somehow, some way that God's going to bless his life,
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.860]   that he's going to be a great person of influence, he's going to have great education,
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:49.040]   he's going to be possibly wealthy and man of influence and so we have great hope.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:56.440]   But when we look at the infancy of Christ, every part of what they did was to prepare
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.560]   him for the cross.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.920]   Used to prepare him for the cross.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:12.120]   Even from birth, every part of that was necessary to confirm that he was going to be the perfect
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.120]   sacrifice.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:21.560]   That he was going to replace Isaac as a sacrifice for our sins.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:29.760]   It puts a completely different spin when you look at this chapter with that perspective.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.600]   To know that Christ didn't just randomly go to the cross.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.480]   He didn't just wait 30 years and live the normal carpenter's life and experience the
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:42.000]   joys and all that comes with being a human being.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:52.680]   All of that is maybe true, but every single part of his life was ordained, willfully chosen,
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:58.240]   where Christ laid down his life for us.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:03.840]   That's why it says in 1 John 3, 2-3, it says, "Beloved, now we are children of God and it
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.600]   has not appeared as yet what we will be.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:12.800]   We know that when he appears, we will be like him because we will see him just as he is.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:19.520]   Everyone who has this hope fixed on him purifies himself just as he is pure."
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:27.560]   Sometimes we get so entangled with the affairs of this world, job, raising children, buying
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:33.360]   a house, and none of these things are innately evil, but we get so entangled in these things
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:38.000]   and we don't realize at times that how much of our hope and desire and how much of our
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.080]   life is consumed coveting things that don't matter.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:55.120]   We confess it doesn't matter because we're here, because it contradicts what we believe.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:02.000]   God willfully is building house upon sand because we know when the storm comes, the
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.840]   sand disappears and everything you built on it is going to be gone.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.520]   We confess that, we believe that, we study that, we memorize that, we teach that to our
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:15.600]   children, yet how often do we see our life pattern, the things that we choose and where
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:22.560]   we're headed is building a bigger house upon the sand that when Christ comes, it will all
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:29.040]   just be wiped out because we forget sometimes.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.200]   And so it's necessary for us from time to time to take a step back and examine our own
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.040]   hearts.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.600]   What is it exactly we are coveting today?
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.680]   What are we longing for?
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.200]   What's the desire that's controlling you?
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.760]   What is the desire in your heart that causes you to invest money a certain way or buy a
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.060]   certain house or go somewhere or do something?
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:55.120]   What is the central thing in your heart that's driving you?
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.720]   Is it a longing for the Comforter to come?
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.720]   Is it for eternity?
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:06.440]   Is it to invest for what can't be destroyed?
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:10.960]   Or have we become entangled with things that ultimately don't matter?
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.960]   You have it, it's good.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.560]   If you don't have it, it's also good.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:21.920]   But as Simeon and as Anna devoted their lives for the coming of the redemption of Christ,
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:28.720]   redemption of Israel, the comfort of Israel, they are here for us that we are to follow
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:36.160]   their example, to long, to pray, to fast, to know that the true problem in our lives
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:43.840]   and our society can only be found, the answer can only be found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:51.600]   Again, the question that we have to ask ourselves is, do you believe that?
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.560]   Do you actually believe that?
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.080]   Or is that just a doctrinal statement you sign or something that you were taught in
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.080]   Sunday school?
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:09.080]   So you just memorize and regurgitate it, but in actual practice, that may not be the case.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.640]   Our prayer as we continue to study the Word of God is to calibrate our hearts, calibrate
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:20.840]   our thoughts, that in our pain and our struggle, to long for the coming of Christ because true
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:29.200]   answer, true freedom, true restoration can only be found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:34.200]   I pray that we would believe that with all our heart and that our lives would be consistent
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.200]   with that faith.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   Let's pray.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:48.120]   Gracious and loving Father, we come before you confessing our weakness, how easily we
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:56.080]   get distracted, how easily, Lord, we get entangled with civilian affairs, longing for things
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:04.860]   that the world longs for, seeking comfort more than anything else, willing to compromise
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:10.520]   what you have called in order that we can have some of the things in this world.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:16.160]   Help us, Lord God, open our eyes that we may continue to see the glory of the gospel of
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:23.500]   Jesus Christ, that we will be sanctified, that we will live each day longing and hoping
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:29.840]   and praying for the coming of Christ to deliver us.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:36.840]   So we pray, Father God, that you would give us soberness, that as Simeon and as Anna long
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.880]   for your coming, that we would live each day longing for that as well.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.440]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:42.800]   Amen.
