[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520]   Finally jumping back in after two months of hiatus, Romans chapter 3 verses 9, and I'll
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.280]   be reading up to verse 18.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.120]   Romans chapter 9, sorry, chapter 3 verse 9 through 18.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.880]   Reading out of the ESV, "What then?
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.320]   Are we Jews any better?
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.560]   No, not at all.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.920]   For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, as it is written,
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.200]   'None is righteous, no, not one.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.200]   No one understands.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.720]   No one seeks for God.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.980]   All have turned aside together.
[00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.280]   They have become worthless.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.280]   No one does good, not even one.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.480]   Their throat is an open grave.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.560]   They use their tongues to deceive.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.480]   The venom of asps is under their lips.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.380]   Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.320]   Their feet are swift to shed blood.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.640]   In their paths are ruin and misery, and the way of peace they have not known.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.960]   There is no fear of God before their eyes."
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.960]   Let's pray.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.300]   Gracious and loving Father, we entrust this time to you, asking Lord God that even in
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.320]   our weakness, that your Holy Spirit may be strong.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.720]   That you would speak to us, Lord, in our complacency.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.040]   You would speak to us, Lord God, in rebellion.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.960]   You would speak to us even in righteousness.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.780]   That we would be utterly dependent upon Christ and his work.
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.540]   That all that we do and all that we claim and all that we worship, Lord God, would be
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.040]   simply a response, a reasonable response to the great mercy that you showed in us, that
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.160]   you continue to show us, that we are absolutely dependent upon to move forward and to be sanctified.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.920]   So we ask, Lord God, that your Holy Spirit would speak through your word.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.600]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.480]   As you guys know, we are in the midst of a political season, so you've been probably
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.000]   hearing a lot of speeches from different politicians.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.280]   There's been debates with the Democrats and the Republicans, and again, all the years
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.880]   that I've been watching the primaries and the elections going on, I've never seen as
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.720]   much attention given to this election than probably any other election.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.440]   And I think part of the reason is because of the environment of what's going on around
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.440]   the world.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.580]   There's a crisis with the migrants, there's a financial crisis, there's a crisis within
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.580]   this country.
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.600]   It seems like the liberals and the conservatives are more far apart than it's ever been.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.560]   And so the question is, are we going to continue down this path, or is there something radical
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.600]   that's going to happen?
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.200]   So who do we pick that's going to lead and take us to the next generation?
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.880]   And so there's a lot of speech and a lot of attention given to what people are saying.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.160]   But there's one thing that's consistent that I've seen, that in order to be elected in
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.480]   the United States, you have to be a confessing Christian.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.580]   You have to be.
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.340]   Even if you're not.
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.880]   If you're not a confessing Christian, the majority of the country will kind of say,
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.920]   "Well, he's not part of us."
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.240]   But here's the other side.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.160]   You can't be a true evangelical Christian either.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:10.480]   You can't be a committed, evangelistic, Bible-believing, Gospel-believing, teaching Christian, or else
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.320]   you're not going to get elected either.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.800]   So in order to get elected, you have to be a confessing, nominal Christian.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.440]   Just enough so that the country will feel like, "He's part of us.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.520]   He's not strange."
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.720]   But if you're too serious, he's like, "Okay, you're too radical.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.400]   You're going to do strange things."
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.040]   And so you see the politicians, when they first come on the scene, and especially with
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.040]   this group.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.560]   Right now, there's a lot of politicians, especially on the Republican side, who have no experience.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.560]   They come in and you see them saying outrageous stuff, but as the months go by, you can see
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.880]   them toning it down, and their verbiage and their language is kind of adjusting to what
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.560]   they know is going to get them elected and not get elected.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.120]   And they're just, again, I don't know if the word "wise" fits, but they're being pragmatic.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.280]   They have to adjust in order for them to get elected, and then once they get elected, they'll
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.480]   do whatever they want.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.980]   But that political environment of, if we want to reach the masses, our language and our
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.680]   promises and what we say and how we say it, it has to match the majority, or else the
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.160]   majority aren't going to give them the vote.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.400]   The sad thing about that is that in the world that we live in, and advertising, if you're
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.080]   going to make a product, you don't shoot for the fringes, you shoot for the middle.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.080]   Right?
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.080]   So the biggest number of people will be interested in your product, and it's no different in
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.280]   politics, but the sad thing is, Christianity has become the same.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.480]   We are more concerned about reaching the masses than we are about commitment to the truth.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.560]   Because we've grown up in a culture where certain things about the Bible, certain things
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.920]   about the Gospel, is not palatable to this generation.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.300]   So we've been shooting, at least in our generation, we've been shooting toward the middle.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.300]   What do we need to say?
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.300]   What do we need to tone down?
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.480]   Or what are some things that need to be said in a certain way?
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.720]   In order for the masses to be interested, to get as many people to come to our churches.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.080]   But in the context of doing so, we have compromised the Gospel.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.480]   And as a result of compromising the Gospel, Christianity doesn't look much like what we
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.480]   see in Scripture.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.240]   And so, it isn't until people actually start starting the Bible, and start reading the
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.400]   Bible for themselves, not listening to sermon, not just reading certain books, but starting
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.000]   the Scriptures for themselves, and realizing that a lot of what we are experiencing doesn't
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.760]   match what we see in Scripture.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.720]   Apostle Paul has been spending three chapters, pounding one statement.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.840]   And that one statement is summarized in Romans 3.23, "For all have sinned and fall short
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.680]   of the glory of God."
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.600]   The text that we just looked at in Romans 3.9 says, "What then?
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.840]   Are we Jews any better off?"
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.440]   Not at all, for we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.600]   In other words, what Paul is saying in verse 9, is that what I'm about to tell you, what
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.360]   I'm about to dive into, is not anything new.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.560]   I've said this, and I've pounded this.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.640]   Romans 1.18, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.160]   of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth."
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.560]   In other words, he's saying, he says, "Mankind has rejected God, not because there wasn't
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.440]   enough opportunity, that there wasn't enough knowledge."
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.760]   He says, "They chose the darkness rather than the light."
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.520]   And that's why they're under condemnation.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.240]   Romans 12.2.12, "For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.920]   And all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law."
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.520]   In other words, not only the Gentiles are guilty, but Jews are equally guilty.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.520]   And so, he's been saying basically the same things for three chapters.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.560]   Even just the one statement of saying, "Hey, we're all sinners.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.920]   We've all fallen short of the glory of God.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.440]   We're all under the judgment of God."
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:09.000]   Even just that one statement, at least in this world, will get some kind of a reaction.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.560]   But Paul spends three chapters introducing himself.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.400]   And you have to remember, the main reason why Paul writes the Book of Romans is because
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.160]   his goal was not to be in Rome.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.160]   He was going to stop by Rome, and then he was going to get some support and support
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.000]   finances.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.840]   Maybe some other workers to get along.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.800]   And so, he's introducing himself, saying, "I'm going to stop by Rome, and I want to
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.080]   connect with you guys, but ultimately I want to go to Spain and get your support."
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:42.760]   Now, that's a strange way to open up a statement saying, "Hey, I need your support, you sinners."
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.760]   All under condemnation.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.680]   You worthless, no one seeking God, not even one.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.600]   The Jews and Gentiles alike, all are without excuse.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.360]   "Give me some money to go to Spain."
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.920]   That's basically what he's going to say, right?
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.120]   In 2 Corinthians, the harshest letter he ever writes, right?
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.520]   After rebuking them over and over, and at the end of Corinthians, he says, "Hey, get
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   ready.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.520]   I'm coming.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.520]   Collect the money.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.520]   God loves a cheerful giver.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.520]   See you soon.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.520]   Love you, Paul."
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.560]   Like, that's basically how he writes 2 Corinthians.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.440]   This guy did not care.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.800]   And when I studied that, what that reminds me of is, this guy was, he didn't care about
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   PC.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   He didn't care what they thought.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.800]   He was just committed to the truth.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:32.360]   And as he says, "And after my foot, if I do not preach Christ, if it led him to prison,
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.400]   if people didn't give him money or gave him money, if he was beaten or not beaten, that
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.580]   was not his goal."
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.760]   Sometimes preaching the gospel will drive people away.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.420]   Sometimes people will repent.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.380]   Sometimes the church will shrink.
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.000]   Sometimes the church will grow.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.760]   And that's exactly what Paul told Timothy, in season and out of season, preach the gospel.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.800]   The whole counsel of God.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.040]   I could easily preach the gospel just highlighting certain things that encourage you.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.040]   I could.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.280]   And spend the rest of my life doing that and say, and promise you every week that you'll
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.360]   be leaving this room encouraged.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:15.000]   And I could do that by preaching the gospel, but certain aspects of the gospel every single
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.740]   week.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.280]   But in my own conscience, I know that that is not the whole counsel of God.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.400]   See, Paul doesn't waste any energy.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.640]   He jumps in and he spends three chapters pounding it just in case that they didn't get it.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.680]   This text that we're looking at here is kind of like the crescendo.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.680]   Right?
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.560]   It's kind of like you play music and then you kind of build up and build up and then
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.560]   bam!
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.560]   Right?
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.240]   Chapter three, the text that we're looking at is the crescendo where this is the main
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.320]   thing that he's been trying to say.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:50.140]   And he quotes five or six different texts in the Old Testament to make his point.
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:55.520]   In other words, that what he's about to say isn't anything new to the New Testament.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.680]   In fact, all of the Old Testament was the main point.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.940]   He said the law came to make sin utterly sinful.
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.040]   I don't know if you've ever studied through the book of Leviticus, and I'm assuming most
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:11.020]   of you probably have heard sermons or maybe, you know, even as I was preaching through
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.620]   Leviticus, you know, I would say, "Oh, this pastor preaches."
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.940]   I would go look up in the sermons.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.580]   There's two sermons on Leviticus, you know, or three sermons or one sermon.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.940]   But expositionally, verse by verse, I mean, you don't see much of that in the book of
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.100]   Leviticus because it's hard.
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.700]   It takes a lot of time to sift through.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.700]   What does this mean?
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.700]   What does this measurement mean?
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.300]   Why is he doing this?
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.460]   But the book of Leviticus, the whole book of Leviticus is to make one point.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.460]   Right?
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.780]   God is holy and you are sinners.
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.860]   That's the whole point of the book of Leviticus.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.860]   Right?
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:47.300]   So, if you ever study the book of Leviticus, the point of that is to prepare you for the
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.940]   coming of Christ.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:55.660]   The whole history of the nation of Israel, God begins by saying, "If you keep the law,
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.660]   here's the blessing.
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.060]   But if you don't keep the law, here's all these cursings."
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:05.260]   If you study the book of Deuteronomy, where that happens, the cursing is twice as long
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.020]   as the blessing.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.540]   It's almost like God is saying, "This is what's going to happen.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.540]   Here's the curses."
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:16.900]   And so, all of Israel's history is curse upon curse upon curse being added upon the sins
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.900]   of Israel.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:22.780]   So, by the time we get to the very last chapter of the book of Malachi, you don't come out
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.740]   thinking, "Thank God."
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.500]   You come out, you should come out saying, "Woe is me.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.500]   Woe is me.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.660]   I'm a man of unclean lips from a people of unclean lips."
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.700]   And that was the whole point.
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.820]   When Jesus showed up, God had been preparing them for hundreds and hundreds of years for
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.140]   the coming of Christ.
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:47.500]   And the reason why they missed it is because they did not recognize a need for a Savior.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.740]   They wanted a Messiah.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.220]   They wanted a King.
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.300]   But they didn't see the need for a Savior.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:59.660]   See, that's why Paul is spending three chapters pounding this.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.740]   And let me say this.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:07.740]   If you haven't been listening, or if it doesn't make sense, I don't think there's anybody
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.740]   in this room.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.940]   If you've been in church for any period of time that doesn't know that God saved you
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.940]   from your sins.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.460]   Anyone would say, "Well, okay, that's the beginning of the gospel, right?
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.360]   God saved us from our sins."
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.660]   But how deeply you understand that is going to, it will determine what your life looks
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.460]   like.
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:31.220]   Your thankfulness and your worship isn't just the songs that you sing.
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.060]   That God saved you from your sins.
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.240]   And you say, "Okay, I believe that.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.660]   Maybe those people need to hear it.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.460]   Maybe those people from other churches where the gospel is not preached, maybe they need
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.420]   to hear it."
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:47.180]   The impact of the gospel can be seen in your life.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:54.700]   If somebody gives you a present that you can't possibly repay, it's going to affect you.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.500]   You're going to say, "Thank you."
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.700]   There's going to be a sense of gratitude in their presence.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.420]   You don't just say, "Oh yeah, that was a great gift.
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.420]   That was good.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.420]   Of course I understand it.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.420]   That was a great gift."
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:10.140]   It can't just be a confession of mouth.
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:15.980]   It's absolutely essential to our sanctification that we recognize that what Paul is saying
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.340]   is true in these three chapters.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:23.500]   That's why he repeats over and over again, "None is righteous, no not one."
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:29.180]   Just in case there's anybody reading this Bible and saying, "Yes, they need to hear
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.800]   this.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.020]   Those people need the gospel.
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.140]   Those people need forgiveness."
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.460]   If there's anybody who's reading this.
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.700]   But you know what?
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.820]   I've never met anybody, Christian or non-Christian, who says that they're not sinners.
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.220]   I know some people will say, "Well, I'm not that bad."
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.700]   If you ask them, "Have you ever sinned?"
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:55.980]   I've never heard anybody say, "I've never sinned, ever.
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.100]   You just lied right there.
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.060]   You just sinned right there."
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:03.380]   I've never heard anybody who said that they never sinned.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.820]   Most people say, "Of course we sin."
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.540]   But they don't see the gravity of their sin.
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.300]   They say, "Of course we sin, but we're not, I didn't kill anybody.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.540]   I pay my taxes.
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:15.620]   I'm an honest person.
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.540]   I'm not perfect."
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.900]   Paul says, "Not one is righteous, no not one.
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.380]   No one understands."
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.940]   It's like, is he exaggerating?
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.500]   No one seeks God.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.500]   Nobody.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.060]   All have turned aside.
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.540]   Here they have become worthless.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.740]   How does that make you feel?
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.900]   God just said, "We're all worthless."
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.020]   I thought, "What?"
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.300]   I thought he loved us.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.780]   I thought we were precious in his eyes.
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.340]   I thought we were the apple of his eye.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.700]   He says, "No, everybody turned away.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.020]   No one's seeking God.
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.500]   We have all become worthless.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.780]   No one does good.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.900]   Not even one."
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.460]   See this doesn't sit well in our generation.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:06.420]   Where our egos have been stroked and our self-esteem has been so catered to.
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.420]   That statement.
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.180]   Again, if I didn't quote the Bible and I just said this to you, I'll bet you right after
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:17.780]   service I'm going to have people coming up to me like, "What are you preaching?"
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.660]   All I did was quote the scriptures.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.300]   So if you're angry, just go outside, look at the Bible, "What are you preaching?"
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.620]   Say it to the Bible.
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.620]   I just quoted scripture.
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.900]   But again, in our generation, that statement, it just automatically doesn't sit well.
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.100]   It's like, "Is that, is he interpreting that correctly?
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.780]   Maybe that's an exaggeration.
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.780]   Is that hyperbole?
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.780]   What is that?
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.980]   Did God really say that?
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.980]   Yes, he said that.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.100]   I just read scripture.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.820]   Why does he say that?"
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:52.740]   See the Jews, they prided themselves about being the experts of the law.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.820]   They thought that they were closer to God because they knew the Bible.
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.820]   They were the experts.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.140]   They were the ones that everybody went to because they studied the scripture.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.540]   You know, we can easily say, "Oh, they didn't study the scripture."
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.780]   No, they studied the scripture.
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.260]   They were the experts of the law.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:14.540]   If you wanted to know what Moses said and what the Torah was, they had it memorized.
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:20.180]   More than any PhD, an average Jew who took their faith seriously knew more about the
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.100]   Torah than a PhD in our generation.
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.380]   That's how much they were into the Torah.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.100]   And yet he says, "Nobody understands."
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.860]   With all their education, all the time they put into the study of the Torah, they did
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.380]   not understand.
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.180]   Not one sought out God.
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.420]   I mean, think about it, if you're a Jew hearing this.
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:46.660]   They're going to the temple three, four, five times a week.
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.580]   They're fasting twice a week.
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.300]   I mean, so maybe they didn't, they were greedy for money.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.300]   They gave.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:59.180]   They tithed even cumin, even, you know, spices.
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.380]   That's how meticulous they were about their giving.
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.140]   Oh, maybe they didn't proselytize.
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.980]   Jesus said, "You will travel over distances."
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.780]   They were proselytizing.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:14.020]   Anything that you and I can think of as what a righteous person would do, the Jews did
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.620]   it.
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:22.080]   And yet, he says, "All your studying, all your going to the temple, all your evangelism,"
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.140]   he says, "but no, no one is truly seeking God.
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.540]   All have turned aside.
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.020]   Together they have become worthless."
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.020]   Worthless?
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:35.980]   All of that was worthless?
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:41.260]   All my pursuit of God, all of the learning, all of the sacrifices, no one does good?
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:45.260]   Not even one.
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.940]   Could this possibly be true?
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.220]   Or is this just an exaggeration just to get our attention?
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.680]   You know?
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.380]   Sometimes we exaggerate, especially when we have problems with people, we have a tendency
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.380]   to exaggerate.
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.620]   That guy is this way, or this church is that.
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.620]   And I hear that all the time.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:06.180]   You know, after being in ministry for a while, I've learned to filter what people say.
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.220]   So I'm not a big fan of Yelp, because I just don't trust it.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.220]   You know what I mean?
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.500]   I've been to so many restaurants, or a few restaurants I went to, and said, "Oh, we get
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.500]   four and a half stars.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.860]   I go there, I will never come back here."
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.180]   There are some places you've suggested.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.140]   I will never trust you again.
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.260]   I just don't have the same taste as you do.
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.780]   You know, there's a lot of people that come to church, and we hear it all the time.
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.020]   It's like, "Oh, Brian is like this, and Brian is like that."
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.220]   And usually it's very exaggerated.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:39.220]   You know, a lot of times it's, "Oh, Brian, everybody loves Jesus."
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.540]   Not everybody.
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.220]   Or they would say, "Oh, everybody is so unfriendly.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.620]   You know, and Brian is like this."
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.580]   And usually it's an encounter between another person that they had, or maybe they met somebody
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.260]   who had a bad day, and sitting next to that person, they weren't friendly, and they just
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.100]   didn't get a good vibe.
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.540]   And then they leave and say, "Brian, they don't care about newcomers, and they hate
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.540]   whatever."
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:05.740]   And they throw 450 people under the bus because they had experience with one person.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.820]   So we have a tendency to exaggerate.
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.040]   We do that individually, but we especially do that in large groups.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.580]   So when I read this, I'm thinking, "Is he exaggerating?
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:23.940]   Could it possibly be that nobody, nobody understands, nobody is seeking God, not even
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.940]   one?
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.340]   We have together become worthless?"
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:35.140]   That's exactly what he says.
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.700]   How do we understand that?
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.340]   He goes even further, and he describes what that worthlessness looks like.
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.020]   Their throat is an open grave.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.220]   You ever notice that whenever the scripture describes about man's rebellion against God,
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.540]   one of the first sins that he mentions is about his speech?
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.340]   You know how Jesus says, "It's not what you put into you, but what comes out of you."
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.900]   And he says, "Your speech reveals your sin."
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.940]   And it's so true.
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.900]   Whenever there is sin, or bitterness, or anger, it comes out in slander.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.180]   Exaggeration of other people's sins, and how we're discontent.
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.860]   And then he goes on, he says, "Their throat is an open grave.
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.720]   They use their tongue to deceive.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.420]   The venom of ass is under their lips.
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.300]   Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.180]   Their feet are swift to shed blood.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.860]   In their path, ruin and misery.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.140]   And the way of peace they have not known."
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.780]   And here's the summary of everything that he's been saying.
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:30.720]   There is no fear of God before their eyes.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.860]   There is no fear of God before their eyes.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:44.080]   The whole reason why sin exists is because there is no fear of God before their eyes.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:49.840]   Think about at the underlying reason why we don't take our faith as seriously as we ought
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.520]   to.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.420]   Why people are not afraid to die in our generation.
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:00.760]   Because there is no fear of God before their eyes.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.820]   We are more fear of men and their opinions.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.920]   And that's why we shoot for the middle instead of the truth.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:15.740]   We're more afraid of not having financial security tomorrow.
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.200]   So we pursue after money.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:22.480]   We're more afraid of the opinions of other people and the friendships that we have.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.400]   So we invest more in human friendship than we do in our personal relationship with God.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:35.280]   And at the core of it, he says, it's because there is no fear of God before their eyes.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.320]   In our generation, again, this message is so unpalatable.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.560]   It's kind of like, okay, you know, that's what Berean is about.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.560]   It's about rebuke.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.080]   You know, years ago, I got invited.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.480]   Some of you guys know because I shared it with you.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:54.640]   Years ago, I got invited to come to a campus ministry to preach.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.440]   But going to that campus ministry, I got an email from one of our members saying that
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.200]   their campus ministry is having issues.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:06.360]   And the issue was the leadership, not just the members, the leadership was actually inviting
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.640]   people to go get drunk with them.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.880]   So they sent out an e-mail saying that somebody's turning 21.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.040]   So we're going to go to this club.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.560]   And they forwarded me the email that they sent.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:22.120]   And Evi basically said, come bring your own beer because we're getting butt drunk.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.260]   Somebody's turning 21.
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.280]   So she sent this to me disturbed, you know, looking at this.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.880]   Well, right in the middle of that, the leader of that campus ministry asked me to come and
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.880]   speak.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.880]   So I said, okay, I'll come.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.880]   And I said, what do you want me to speak on?
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:40.480]   They said, can you speak on holiness?
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:47.720]   So you know, that may sound coincidental, but half the times when people ask me to come
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.080]   and speak, it's about holiness.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.900]   Because I think I have a reputation of being angry.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.660]   So why don't you give the sermon that you're good at giving?
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.660]   You know?
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.260]   So they asked me to speak on holiness.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.900]   And I didn't know when this event was going to happen.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.460]   I didn't look at the timeline or whatever.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.140]   And I just got so sick that night.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:09.660]   And I wasn't sure if I was going to make it.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.260]   And then David Rim, who happened to be in law school at that time in San Diego, found
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:14.260]   out I was sick.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.880]   And he drove all the way from San Diego, picked me up, took me to UCLA.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.980]   And then he had to study.
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.200]   And so I was sick until I got up to speak.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.200]   You know?
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.200]   And then I got up to speak.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.200]   And I knew I had to address this issue.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.680]   And I can honestly tell you, it's probably the most harshest rebuke I've ever given in
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.680]   my life.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.500]   And some of you guys heard some harsh issues, harsh sermons.
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.760]   But this was the hardest sermon.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.880]   In my own opinion, that was really hard.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.760]   Because I read that email, and they asked me, so it kind of fit.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.360]   So I said, okay, I'm not going to hold back.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.000]   And I was very specific.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.200]   And I told them, there's some of you guys in this room who are leaders here, who are
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.560]   not going to make it after this.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.480]   And I don't think you're serious about your faith.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.360]   And I told, there's some of you who are in this room who are bothered by this.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.080]   And I said, don't let these posers take over this ministry.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.120]   And I let them have it for about 40 minutes.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.680]   And I could tell they were very uncomfortable.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.320]   And I could tell who they were.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.760]   Because they were squirming.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.480]   They wouldn't make eye contact with me.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.440]   Because if they did, I would have preached directly toward them.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.800]   So I went at it for 40, 45 minutes.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:26.320]   And I was very specific about what they were doing, the E-Bite that they went out.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.680]   And I found out, after it was over, it was that night.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.280]   So they were very uncomfortable.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.560]   I ruined the night for them.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.440]   And all the seniors were going to attend this.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.440]   And then they were going to go out.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.160]   And then I happened to give a message on that.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.600]   And then after it was over, I can tell they were angry.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.120]   Yeah, they were angry.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:49.680]   I had maybe a room full of maybe 150, 160 people.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.640]   Two people came up to me and said, oh, Pastor Peter, thank you for the sermon.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.440]   And they told me that they actually tried to confront them.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.520]   And then they got targeted, saying you're a legalist and whatever.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.400]   And they were kind of marginalized.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.560]   And again, these were leaders in this ministry.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.960]   And the rest of them were so angry.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.960]   And I could tell.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.680]   Usually, they'd come up, and I would talk to them, ask questions.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.240]   They would, boom, they'd boot out.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.000]   Obviously, they never invited me again.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   I never heard from them.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.400]   And I heard how angry they were of what I said and how I said it and all this stuff.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.040]   And the leader who invited me afterwards came up to me.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.760]   And basically, it kind of like-- he wanted to rebuke me.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.080]   But he couldn't, because he was so much younger.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.600]   And so he was kind of gently saying, Pastor Peter, why did you say it like that?
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.600]   And I go, what do you mean?
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.920]   He's like, you know, maybe what you could have said was, I know it's hard, and maybe
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.120]   certain things we shouldn't.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.760]   But I believe in you.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.440]   And it's kind of encouraging, so they could leave encouraged.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:56.480]   And I was thinking to myself, no, I did that on purpose.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.800]   Encouragement was not what they needed.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.880]   They were so bold in their sin.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.080]   They weren't like, is this OK?
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.080]   No, it wasn't that.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.920]   They sent out an invite, saying we're going to get butt drunk tonight.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.040]   So come with us.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.960]   And they rebuke people who confronted them.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.480]   They don't need my encouragement.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.760]   I did exactly that, and I would do it again.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.800]   And I told them, that's not what they needed.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.520]   And again, I encouraged them.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:28.520]   I said, you guys who know that this is wrong, you need to take over this ministry.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.320]   Get these posers out.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.320]   They shouldn't be in leadership.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:36.800]   And again, I'm a guest speaker, so.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.360]   And that was probably the harshest message that I gave, and I think for years to come,
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.360]   they say, ah, you know, Breen is angry.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.360]   Breen is legalistic.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.240]   Breen is this and that.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.240]   But again, I think that shows, again, our generation.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:54.600]   It's sad to say, if I say, oh, that's that one group, and that's that one group of leaders
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.520]   that was having that issue.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:01.180]   But sad to say, that's not unique to them.
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.360]   Why is this so important?
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:15.000]   If we don't recognize, if we're not broken for our sins, the gospel is not good news.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.200]   If we're not careful, the health and wealth gospel, we normally just kind of bash and
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:25.400]   say, oh, those people on a certain channel with certain hair, and drive a certain car,
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:31.720]   and they get $320 million jets, you know, those people, ah, they disgust me.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:37.760]   But the health and wealth principle sneaks in all of us.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.840]   Think carefully.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.600]   What causes you to celebrate?
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   What causes you to celebrate?
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:48.520]   You're going to get a good job.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.760]   When you're sick, you become healthy.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:58.120]   When your relationships are going well, you have good friendship.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.080]   I say, praise God.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.080]   God answered my prayer.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.080]   Thank God for his blessing.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.480]   We got a new church building.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.000]   Thank God, God is so good.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.720]   But when bad things happen, when we're not in good health, we lose our job, our finances,
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.480]   investments that we made didn't go right, our relationship is strained, and things aren't
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.920]   exactly what it is.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.880]   Remember, think of the way that we respond to that.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.720]   Why is God not answering our prayers?
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:32.680]   If we're not careful, we can easily make Jesus into another Buddha, another idol.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:38.080]   For the same reason why they go to their idols, we go to Jesus, and we think that somehow
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.240]   that's the blessing.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:44.960]   But see, what Paul is trying to convey, even before he gets into the heart of the Gospel,
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.120]   is that they have to recognize the primary reason why he came was to save us from our
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.320]   sins.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:58.600]   So even if for the rest of our lives we live in sickness, even if the rest of our lives
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:05.920]   our financial things aren't in order, we owe him our praise for eternity.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:12.600]   Until we recognize the depth of the sin that he saved us from, our worship will always
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.380]   remain shallow.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:20.240]   Our response to him will always be superficial.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.840]   That's why Paul spent three chapters, and again, he's not done.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.400]   He's going to reintroduce this over and over again.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:31.840]   See, but our problem here in the Church, you know, is that maybe those non-Christians need
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.320]   to hear the truth.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:39.560]   This is just as relevant inside the Church because the way we confess sins typically
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:44.080]   is "I know I'm bad, but I'm not as bad as others."
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.000]   I know I'm not perfect, but at least I'm not like that.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.200]   You know, we go to a Bible-teaching church where the Gospel is taught and the Word of
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:57.080]   God is not compromised, so therefore, you know, "Yeah, I'm not perfect, but I'm not…"
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:07.000]   See, there's self-righteousness that creeps in inside of us where it nullifies our repentance.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.600]   Self-righteous people always repent superficially.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.100]   "Lord, forgive me my sins, but thank God I'm not like those people."
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.720]   It's never like the tax collector pounding his chest.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.240]   "I am unworthy of you."
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:25.760]   We are typically more disgusted with the sins of others than our own sins.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.260]   And that's what causes all kinds of problems in the Church.
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:35.540]   Because we expect other people to be a certain level of righteousness, but we also want the
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.440]   Church to be gracious to us.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.000]   Do you remember sin of David?
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   You know, I can't think of a sin, you know, maybe a few instances where the sin of the
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.240]   King of Israel was more horrendous than this man David.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.320]   David, the man after God's own heart.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.000]   He ends up committing adultery simply because he could.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   He was the King of Israel.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.480]   He could do whatever he wanted.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.480]   Who's going to call him out?
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.420]   He's the guy who makes the law.
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:09.480]   He commits adultery, takes another man's wife, and in order to cover it up, he ends up murdering
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.120]   him.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.800]   And he, it wasn't just any man.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.880]   This is one of the valiant men who are loyal to him.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.440]   He wouldn't even come sleep in the bed because he said, "My soldiers are out there fighting.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.440]   How can I do this?"
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.720]   And he would sleep on the doorstep even while he was on break.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.760]   And it's that man he killed.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.920]   After he kills him, he just moves on because he's the King.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.800]   Who's going to indict him?
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.680]   And he just went on.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.680]   He didn't get caught.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.680]   Nothing happened.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.320]   But obviously, it didn't escape God's eyes.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:49.200]   He sends the prophet Nathan to David, and then he says to him, "He came to him and said
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:54.960]   to him, 'There were two men in certain city, the one rich and the other poor.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.280]   The rich man had very many flocks and herds, but the poor man had nothing but one little
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.160]   ewe lamb, which he had bought.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.840]   And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.000]   It used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup and lie in his arms, and it was like
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.640]   a daughter to him.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:15.160]   Now there came a trouble to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.520]   flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:24.680]   But he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him."
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.600]   Now Nathan presents a scenario, and all he's talking about is a lamb.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.320]   Here's a rich man who had everything.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:34.120]   And here's a poor man comes, and all he has is a few, and he takes the poor man, takes
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.720]   advantage of him just because he could.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:42.960]   David's response when he hears the sin of this rich man, "David, anger was greatly kindled
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.960]   against the man.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:50.040]   And he said to Nathan, 'As the Lord lives, the man who has done this deserves to die.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:56.480]   And he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity.'
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:02.320]   When he thought that this was another man's sin, he said, 'How could this be?
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.640]   We need to correct this sin.'
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.120]   His anger was greatly kindled."
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.320]   So imagine the story that he just told.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.320]   It was about a lamb.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:16.800]   But the sin that he committed was about a human being.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:22.120]   You took his wife, and then you murdered him.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:28.680]   But he was righteously, he had righteous indignation because he didn't recognize that this was
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:32.680]   his sin that he's trying to reveal.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:39.080]   How righteous we feel when it comes to other people's sins.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.080]   Why are we not dealing with them?
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.600]   Why are they this way?
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:48.940]   And how the righteous indignation when we don't recognize it as our sins, but Nathan
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:53.040]   turns it around and he says, "You are that man.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.040]   I anointed you as king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:01.280]   I gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your arms, and you gave the house
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.480]   of Israel and of Judah.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.360]   And if this was too little, I would add to you as much more.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.860]   Why have you despised the word of the Lord to do what is evil in his sight?
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:15.040]   You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.960]   wife and have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites."
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:28.160]   When you consider what he did, when you consider who he did it to, and when you consider what
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.480]   God did for David.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:37.000]   I mean, his sin that he thought was brought to him, and he was righteously indignated,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.040]   and he was so angry over that man's sin.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.040]   We have to do something about that.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:46.080]   But his sin was a hundred times worse.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:56.200]   You see, you and I do not recognize how hideous our sin is before our holy, holy, holy God.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:00.600]   And that's why it just doesn't seem that big of a deal.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.480]   Of course I lust, but at least I'm not watching pornography on a regular basis.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.960]   Of course I watch pornography, but it's not a regular part of my life.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.600]   Of course I cut corners, but I'm not a liar.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.760]   Of course I lie, but I didn't steal.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:19.520]   Of course I slander, but I didn't murder anybody.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.760]   Adam and Eve, when they were caught in sin and God confronted them about their sin, they
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.160]   never denied what they did.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.160]   They didn't say, "No, no, no, I didn't do that.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.440]   How can they deny that before God?"
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.440]   He says, "Yes, yes, we did that.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:36.840]   But the woman you put into the garden, she introduced sin.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.880]   He goes to Eve and said, "What happened to you?
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.640]   Why did you disobey my commandment?"
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:45.680]   The serpent, the serpent in the garden deceived me."
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.360]   And if you examine that carefully, basically they were deferring their guilt, at least
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.720]   some of it, some of it to God.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.400]   I am what I am because look at our church.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.460]   I am what I am because of look at our people.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.720]   Look at our circumstances.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.160]   You don't know.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:08.480]   So indirectly we're deferring our guilt and say, "Some of it is your fault.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:13.200]   I take some responsibility, but a big portion of it is because you gave me no choice."
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:20.080]   See, a self-righteous man is unrepentant.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:24.960]   And until we repent, you will never meet God.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.040]   Forgiveness is offered to those who recognize their sin and repent.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:35.720]   And as if your repentance is superficial, your recognition of what you have in Christ
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.960]   will also be superficial.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:45.040]   Of course you're thankful, but you're not thankful enough to change your lives.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:49.280]   Of course you're thankful, but it doesn't have a deep, lasting impact.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.280]   It's just words.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.280]   It's just the way you think, maybe the way you feel.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.920]   It doesn't affect your finances.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.720]   It doesn't affect your friends.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.280]   It doesn't affect your future.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.960]   This is why he pounds over and over and over and over again.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:07.320]   First John 1, 8-10, if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:11.040]   How many of people in here say we have no sins?
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.820]   We look at that passage and say, "No, that doesn't pertain to us."
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:18.240]   It does pertain to us.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.640]   Every single one of us is saying, "Of course we're sinners."
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:24.880]   But we always defer some of that guilt to other people.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.000]   We're not as bad as them.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.920]   You know, the strange thing is, whenever we talk about morality or righteousness, we always
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.760]   compare with lesser people.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.760]   You know, it's like, "Oh yeah, of course I'm sinners, but you know, I'm not getting drunk
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.760]   like those guys.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.760]   I've never done that."
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.720]   Of course, you know, we do this, but I pay my taxes.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:50.740]   So we always compare our righteousness to people that we think are not as righteous
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:51.740]   with us.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:55.160]   You know, the funny thing is, when it comes to money, we always compare with people above
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.160]   us.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.160]   Say, "We're rich.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.320]   Oh, Bill Gates has, you know, how much?
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.100]   Can't be rich.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.280]   You know how much my boss makes?
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.280]   Oh, I have a friend.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.440]   I thought I had a nice house until I went to their house and, oh, they're kind of gaudy."
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:14.440]   Because we always, like, when it comes to finances, we always compare higher.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:18.360]   When it comes to our righteousness, we always compare lower, because we feel better about
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:21.280]   our pursuits and what we're doing.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.740]   If we say that we have no sins, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:31.620]   If we confess our sins, if we expose and acknowledge our sins, He is faithful and just
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.560]   to forgive us our sins.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.760]   Do you see that condition?
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:41.880]   If we confess, if we superficially embrace our guilt, then our confession wouldn't be
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.560]   honest.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.620]   He is faithful to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:52.240]   If we say we have not sinned, we make Him out to be a liar and His Word is not in us.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:58.520]   Not only do we not receive forgiveness, we make Him out to be a liar, because everything
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:03.000]   about the Gospel is about sin.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.680]   Jesus didn't come walk on this earth so that He can relate with you, primarily.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.680]   You say, "Ah, He's a faithful high priest.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.200]   He sympathizes with our weaknesses."
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.120]   All that is true.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.360]   But the primary reason He came is not so that He can relate to you.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.720]   It's like, "I just wanted to know what you go through so that I can be a helper when
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.160]   times are hard."
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:27.880]   The primary reason why He came is because we were lost and dead in our trespasses and
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:34.720]   there was no other way to be reconciled with this Holy God.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:35.880]   So we make Him out to be a liar.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:42.160]   It means the whole human history is false, that everything that He did was a lie.
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:46.580]   Everything that we are doing is because of our sins.
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:51.840]   Everything that God promises to give us is despite our sins.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:57.620]   So if we nullify or minimize our sins, we nullify the Gospel.
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.920]   You know how deep our self-righteousness goes.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:08.320]   You know, 1 Corinthians 13, 1-2-3, today is Valentine's Day, so let's look at this verse.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   Okay, so some of you guys may have bought a card, has 1 Corinthians 13 on it, and you
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.840]   know, have weddings.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.720]   That's your vow, put it in there, right?
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:23.360]   It is a beautiful verse to look at, but I want you to look a little bit closer to what
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.720]   He's actually saying.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:29.360]   And again, I want you to understand, Paul is writing 1 Corinthians 13 in the context
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.940]   of rebuking a church.
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.120]   He's not saying, "This is so beautiful.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.560]   You should write this down and hang it on your wall."
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.120]   That's not why he's writing this.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.200]   It's in the context of rebuking a church who went astray.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:47.120]   1 Corinthians 13, 1-2-3, "If I speak in tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:51.040]   am noisy gong or a clanging cymbal."
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:57.320]   If we have superpower utterance of the angels, I mean, if somebody was speaking supernatural
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:02.440]   language from heaven, you would think, "That man must be right with God."
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.560]   You know, you put him on a pedestal, hear everything he has to say, because he must
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.560]   be speaking the truth.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:12.520]   He says, "No, even if you have some kind of special revelation going on, and if you are
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:18.000]   not motivated by love, if it's not love," he says, "it's nothing."
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.120]   He goes on, "And if I have prophetic powers, right, if I have prophetic powers and understand
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:31.400]   all mysteries and have all knowledge," I mean, that's a lot of stuff to have for a person.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.400]   You have all of this.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.400]   You've got all the pages.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.400]   You have 15 PhDs.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.640]   You have all the knowledge, all understanding.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:44.760]   "If I have all faith to remove mountains and have not love, I am nothing."
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.640]   I've never seen anybody move a mountain.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.600]   But I would guess if somebody moved a mountain, that his church would be ginormous.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.600]   You know, just take a video.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.440]   It's like, look at him move mountains.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.200]   He must be speaking from God.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.680]   But he says, "Even if you move mountains and have not love, it's nothing."
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:06.520]   In God's eyes, it's nothing.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.520]   He doesn't stop there.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:12.760]   He goes, "If I give all that I have," like sell everything you have, give to the poor,
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:18.880]   "and if I deliver up my body to be burned but have not love, I gain nothing."
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.400]   Did you hear what he said?
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:27.080]   Even if you are martyred and burned at the stake for the name of Jesus Christ and have
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:32.040]   not love, it means nothing.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.360]   That sounds like an exaggeration.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.680]   What Christian would ever do that?
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:39.680]   To be martyred?
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:43.240]   So you would think that if anybody's going to be martyred, they're super giant Christians
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:48.440]   and they must know something about God.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.120]   Is it possible?
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.120]   Or is he just exaggerating?
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.640]   I mean, think about it.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.680]   You know, that's happening all over the world today.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:00.680]   We have young girls and young boys strapping themselves up, thinking that they have the
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.400]   right thing, and then they blow themselves up and they think they're going to go to heaven
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.360]   or their version of heaven.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:12.720]   You think Christians could not be guilty of that?
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:18.440]   Even in martyrdom, it could be self-righteousness.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.920]   Even in martyrdom.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:27.600]   You can even sell everything you have and give to the poor, and it could be self-righteousness.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.240]   It could be bringing yourself and saying, "Hey, I'm earning my position, so if I do
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:35.160]   all of this stuff, somehow I have a favor before God."
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:42.520]   And now even in these extreme examples, if we are not broken over our sins first and
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:47.920]   foremost, it is for nothing.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:52.400]   Even if I give everything, even if I move mountains, and if we're not first and foremost
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:57.800]   broken over our own sins, not broken over the sins of others, not broken over the sins
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:06.160]   of the world, but over my sins, to come before God and say, "Lord, they need you, but before
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:11.160]   we get to that point, that we're like the tax collector, every single one of us, beating
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.160]   our chest.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.600]   I am that man.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.980]   I am that guy.
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:23.640]   And I can't do anything, and I can't earn anything without your mercy and grace."
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:29.160]   None but a naked man will come to Christ for clothing.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:35.320]   None but a hungry man will come to Christ for food.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:40.120]   That's why Paul is trying to reveal, "This is where you are.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.440]   This is who you are.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.120]   This is what is in you.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.200]   So therefore, come to Christ."
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.880]   The answer is not in this world.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.340]   The answer is not in finances.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.960]   The answer is not with greater friendship.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.160]   The answer is not in organization.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.720]   The answer is not in your willpower.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.800]   Come to me.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:09.940]   Jesus is the only answer to human problem.
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:15.440]   Every generation, every generation, we blame the new generation, saying, "Oh, you know,
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.920]   I hear so many things about the millennials."
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.660]   A lot of you, most of you are millennials.
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:24.440]   I don't know where the age starts, but I'm pretty sure a lot of you fall in that category.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.840]   And there's a lot of my generation ripping on the millennials.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.560]   Millennials are lazy.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.820]   Millennials aren't focused.
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:35.680]   Millennials are entitled.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.840]   I heard the same thing from my parents' generation.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:45.040]   My parents are from immigrant generation, so nobody can match their work ethic.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.560]   I mean, they had two jobs, three jobs.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:51.920]   I have to honestly say, I'm in no way near what they went through.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.280]   But every generation says that.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:57.320]   And if you read history, I mean, you read 1960s, and you have the older people, and
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:01.080]   say, "Ah, these hippies!"
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.220]   This sin is not new.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:10.740]   We didn't figure out sin in my generation, nor will it figure it out in your generation.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.940]   It's always been here, and the answer has always been the same.
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.900]   Christ crucified.
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:22.480]   And until we recognize that, and that I am in need of this, not them.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.260]   And let me finish with this.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:28.360]   When I was younger, we used to sing this song all the time, like on Friday, and it only
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.260]   has like two, three verses.
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:34.120]   And basically it says this, and, "It's me, it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.120]   prayer."
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.740]   Anybody know that song?
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:37.740]   Okay.
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.120]   Okay, some of you.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.120]   All right.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.120]   Thank you.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.120]   [laughter]
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.620]   We used to sing this every Friday night.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.940]   "It's me, it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.500]   It's me, it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer.
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:52.760]   Not my father, not my mother, but it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:56.300]   Not my brother, not my sister, but it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer."
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.780]   And then you would sing that about 20 times, basically.
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:00.780]   That's it.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:01.780]   That's the whole verse.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:09.900]   And it sounds so, you know, childish, maybe even superficial, but that is the beginning
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.360]   of the Gospel.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.740]   That is the beginning of the Gospel.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:20.700]   To come before God and recognize that I'm absolutely lost without Him.
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:27.620]   And every week we come here crying out in dependence, "It's me, I'm in need of your
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:28.620]   forgiveness."
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:33.420]   And it isn't until then Christ will become precious.
