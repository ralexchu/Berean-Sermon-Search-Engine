[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   - All right, good morning.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Welcome to Bering Community Church.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   This morning we have quite a few announcements,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   so I'm gonna just jump right into it.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   If I can have Jen Yeh, she's gonna come up,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   and we have an announcement
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   from our Sisters Women's Ministry, okay?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   - Good morning.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   So this announcement is from Women's Ministry
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   for all women college-aged and above.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   We're gonna be having another round of T-TIME,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   which stands for Titus Two and T.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   We'll be going over a passage in Titus Two,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   and this is where sisters from various life stages
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   will get together in smaller groups
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   at people's homes and discuss the passage
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   during, sorry, oh, and meet over tea and some snacks.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   So the sign-up link is the tiny URL link,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   but we'll also post it on the various media forms.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   The deadline to sign up is Saturday 10/9.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   If you have any questions, please refer them to Grace Kim,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   and her email will be in the announcements as well.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   We really encourage all sisters,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   I know a lot of sisters have shared
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   that they've been wanting to meet other sisters
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   in different life stages and different ministries,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   so we highly recommend all of you to sign up.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Thank you.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   - All right, thank you.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Okay, if you want more information about that,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   it'll be on the website and our church Facebook page.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Also, with the college--
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   college is just starting to open up,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   and semester systems are already open.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   UCI is gonna be open in a couple weeks.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Pastor Nate has said that the college welcome table
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   will be stationed next to the normal welcome table
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   as you're coming in,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   so that's gonna be set up here for probably about a month
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   or a bit longer.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   I don't know how long they're gonna have it,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   so if you have college students
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   or if you are a college student
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   and you want to meet the college pastor
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   or you want more information
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   about the various things that are going on,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   and I think especially in the last--next couple weeks,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   because of the college students that are coming in,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   there's a lot of activities going on,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   so if you want more information about that,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   as you go out to that table,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   it'll say "college table" on it,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   and you'll be able to get more information about that.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   This coming Friday, we have our praise and prayer,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   so our normal Wednesday Bible study,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   home group Bible study, will not be taking place,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   so we encourage you to be at church earlier than 730,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   and so we will have our praise and prayer time together
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   here this coming Friday.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   And then, Brian's membership class.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   If you are interested in becoming a member of the church,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   our next session is starting on September 26th at 9 a.m.,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   so if you go to our next-door building,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   not the cafe, but at the end,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   and the only way to enter that
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   is to go to the other side of the parking lot,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   then walk all the way down,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   and then there's a door that you can enter.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   That's our new youth group room,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   and so that's where the membership class
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   is going to be taking place from now on,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   so if you are planning to become a member and you sign up,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   that's the room that you'll be at,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   and it's an eight-week course
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   led by the various leaders of the church, okay?
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   So please sign up for that.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Please sign up with Pastor Nake,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   and he'll give you more directions about that.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   New visitors welcome lunch.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Our welcome team is hosting a welcome lunch
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   on September 26th at 1230,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   and most likely it will be in this room,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   so please go to the welcome table
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   and let them know that you're interested,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   and they'll give you an e-vite to come to that.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   And so this is not a membership class.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   This is basically just for you to come,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   meet some of the leaders, the welcome team,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   and there will be a brief presentation
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   of what our church is about,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   and so if you're kind of in the process
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   of checking out the church
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   and you want to know what the church is about
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   and to ask some questions,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   then this is the lunch that you want to come.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   So let them know that you're coming
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   so that they can prepare the lunch for you.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Members meeting.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   On October 10th at 2.30 p.m.,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   we have a members meeting here,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   so please mark that on your calendar.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   And then also, ACBC Counseling Mini Conference.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Normally we have a praise and prayer
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   that's scheduled monthly,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   but for our next praise and prayer,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   we're going to be having
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   our ACBC Counseling Mini Conference.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Those of you who went to our summer retreat
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   know that we're trying to push
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   our biblical counseling in our church,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   and so biblical counseling, again,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I want you to kind of get a broad understanding of it.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   It's basically learning how to use the Bible
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   for discipleship and for, you know,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   counseling and encouraging other people.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   How to apply the word of God
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   in the life of a Christian.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   I think that's the easiest way
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   for us to understand that.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   And so we want to encourage as many people
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   to get involved with that,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   and so that coming Friday and Saturday,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   we're going to be having,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   we're going to be watching
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   a biblical counseling conference video,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   the lectures that are going on.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   And so we're going to have,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   start Friday, and then there's going to be
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   three sessions on Saturday.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And so please sign up for that.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   We're asking, the sign up fee is going to be $20,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   and it's going to cover basically your lunch
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   and whatever materials
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   that we're going to be having for that.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   So you do not have to be a member.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   This is not limited to any particular group.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   So you're a college, high school student,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   all the way up to, you know,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   however old you are,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   there's no limitation to age.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   And so please sign up for that
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   so that we can get our facilities
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   and things better prepared.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   And so that will be taking place
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   on October 15th and 16th.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   And then trunk formation,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   which is basically alternative to Halloween
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   that's coming up on October 31st.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   And so if you are able to help
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   with decorating your trunk
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   and providing games
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   so that our kids can come and play
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   out in the parking lot,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   please sign up for that.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   If you can't do that,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   maybe you're just not creative.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   I don't know how to do that,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   and you just have some money.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Okay?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And you want to buy some snacks
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   or prizes that you want to donate.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   They're also taking donations for that,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   so you can just buy candy
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   that they can pass out.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   So one group can prepare the games.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   The other group can just provide the snacks
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   or whatever.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   You can also sign up for that.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   And it doesn't even have to just be candy.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   If you have little knick-knacks
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   that they can use as prizes
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   that can be given out with those games,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   you can also donate that.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   So the people who are in charge
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   is Esther Leong and Sarah Kim.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   So if you don't know who they are,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   their emails will be listed on Facebook
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   and our church app,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   so you can just tell them,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   and there will be some kind of sign-up
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   that you can just sign up and say,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   "Hey, I want to bring this,"
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   and they'll tell you where to drop that off.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   And then finally,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   today is the last day to sign up for BBA,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   which is Brem Basketball Association,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   WBBA, Women's Basketball Association,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   and then Legends Senior/League.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Today is the last day to sign up.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   So again, we said you have to be a member
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   or you're in the process of becoming a member.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   So I guess the Senior League's name
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   is going to be officially changed to Legends League.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   So basically, if you have bad knees, bad back,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   you used to be athletic,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   like Elder Phillips said,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   you just plainly don't have the stamina
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   and you want to play half court,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   so there's no age limit to that,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   so it will be half court.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   And if you are coming there
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   to win some kind of championship,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   you do not belong in this league.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   So today is the last day to sign up for that,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   and then after that,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   you'll be receiving some kind of email
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   to tell you what's going on,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   and all of this will be taking place
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   at the Great Park starting from in a few weeks.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   All right, I think that's it.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   That's it for the announcements.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Let me briefly pray for our offering.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Again, if you're new to the church,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   our physical offering box is in the back over there.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   As you're going out,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   it looks like a little birdhouse.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   It'll say "offering" on it,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   and that's where you'd want to drop off
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   your physical offering.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   And for the rest of you,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   we'll give you a minute to give your offering.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Okay, let's pray.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Heavenly Father, I pray that this time of worship
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   would truly be in spirit and in truth.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Search us and know us
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   and see if there's any hurtful ways in us
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   so that all that we do, all that we say,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   all that we give may be an overflow
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   of the powerful work that you are doing in us.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   We pray for your grace to continue to sustain us,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   empower us, strengthen us,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   that we may honor you,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   that even in our giving,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   that it may be given to you
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   as an act of worship and gratitude.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   May it be multiplied for your use.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   [piano music]

[00:27:48.480 --> 00:28:12.480]   There is no song we could sing to honor the weight of your glory. There are no words we
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:28.480]   could speak to capture the depth of your beauty. Jesus there's no one like you. Jesus would
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:52.480]   love you, ever adore you. There's no one like you. Jesus would love you, ever adore you.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:29:08.480]   There is no sin up beyond the infinite stretch of your mercy. How can we thank you enough
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:24.480]   for how you have loved us completely. Jesus there's no one like you. Jesus would love you,
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:38.480]   ever adore you. There's no one like you. Jesus would love you, ever adore you. There's no
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:54.480]   one like you. Jesus would love you, ever adore you. There's no one like you. Jesus would
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:22.480]   love you, ever adore you. All we have, all we need, all we want is you. All we need is
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   you. All we have, all we need, all we want is you. All we have, all we need, all we want
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:31:14.480]   is you. Jesus there's no one like you. Jesus would love you, ever adore you. There's no
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:38.480]   one like you. Jesus would love you, ever adore you. There's no one like you. Jesus would
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:32:01.480]   love you, ever adore you. There's no one like you.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:11.480]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12. We're going to be
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:17.480]   finishing up this session, section together. Hebrews chapter 12 verses 25 through 29. And
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:24.480]   our focus this morning is going to be on verse 28 and 29. Hebrews chapter 12 verses 25 through
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:31.480]   29. I'm going to be reading out of the NASB. See to it that you do not refuse him who is
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.480]   speaking. For if those did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth,
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:42.480]   much less will we escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven. And his voice shook
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:47.480]   the earth then, but now he has promised saying, yet once more I will shake not only the earth,
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.480]   but also the heaven. This expression yet once more denotes the removing of those things
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:56.480]   which can be shaken as of created things so that those things which cannot be shaken may
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.480]   remain. Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:07.480]   by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and all for our God
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:15.480]   is a consuming fire. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we pray that your word would be open
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:22.480]   to us, speak to us, convict us, reveal the things in our hearts and our lives, Lord God,
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:27.480]   that we may truly be able to give you worship that you deserve. May your word and your word
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:35.480]   only go forth. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. As most of you guys know, yesterday we celebrated
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:43.480]   as a country the 20th year anniversary or remembrance of 9/11. Some of you may remember
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:49.480]   exactly what happened that day. Some of you may have been a bit too young for you to remember.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:54.480]   It's just kind of a news to you, but those of you who remember, and I remember very specifically
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   I was in my house in Corona early in the morning and I got a phone call from one of my former
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:06.480]   students, high school students, and she was so distraught and it was so strange because
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:14.480]   it was like 7 or 7/20 and she was telling me that a plane hit the tower and it was just
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:19.480]   confusing. We don't know what to do and I remember turning on the TV and the plane that
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:25.480]   hit it and no one knew exactly what was going on. At the minimum it looked like a horrific
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:31.480]   accident and then while the TV was on we saw the second plane go into the second building
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:37.480]   and immediately we knew, okay, this was no accident. This was an orchestrated attack
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.480]   and then there was news that another plane hit the Pentagon and another one was headed
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:48.480]   toward the White House and so everything got shut down. And we remember very specifically
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   thinking that we're at war. We didn't know it was going to be just the planes. Is there
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.480]   going to be an actual, you know, soldiers coming into the United States? Is there going
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:04.480]   to be a nuclear bomb going off? And so there was a period of terror, literally, and so
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:10.480]   all the airplanes, so whoever was on, in the sky flying, they just landed wherever they
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:15.480]   were at and then they were stranded for a period and so all this security checks and
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:22.480]   stuff that we have to go through now has been implemented because of that. And again, you
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.480]   may remember years ago we were able to go into Canada and Mexico without a passport.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.480]   Remember? We would just kind of go in with our driver's license and come back and after
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.480]   that they changed the law so that now we have to have a passport because they wanted to
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:42.480]   be a bit more careful with the border control. That's been 20 years, you know, and so I remember
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:48.480]   very specifically the mantra of that time is we will never forget that we are under
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:54.480]   attack. And for the first time, at least in the history of the United States that I remember,
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:36:00.480]   again, prior to Pearl Harbor, where American land was literally attacked and we knew that
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.480]   there were terrorists outside of the borders of the United States but the fact that they
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:13.480]   were able to come into this country and kill senselessly almost 3,000 people kind of gave
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:19.480]   it reality that if these people had their hands in a nuclear bomb, they wouldn't hesitate
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:27.480]   to use it. And so that fear caused everybody in the United States to come together. And
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:33.480]   I remember very specifically that Republicans and Democrats, they, at least from what I
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.480]   remember, they've never really got along, you know, but nothing like it is today. But
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:41.480]   even back then, they were constantly bickering and I remember very specifically in Capitol
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:49.480]   Hill, they stood arm to arm saying that we're at war with these terrorists and that you've
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.480]   attacked us so now we're going to war and that's what started all this war in Afghanistan
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:58.480]   and then into Iraq and war against terrorism. But again, I remember the very specific mantra
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:07.480]   we will never forget. I think most of us will agree that we have forgotten, right? It's
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.480]   just a memory. And so every year when there's a commemoration, obviously it was the 20th
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:19.480]   year so it was bigger than the previous years. But the reason why I say all of this is because
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:24.480]   that particular event caused people who went through that and saw that, caused us to see
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:30.480]   the world differently. That this wasn't the same United States that prior to 9/11, you
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:36.480]   know, how we felt before and how we felt afterwards caused us to see. And it wasn't because
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:42.480]   evil was created by 9/11. It just kind of reminded us there are people who are willing
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:47.480]   to do that if you give them an opportunity. So we need to be constantly vigilant and be
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:54.480]   ready. I say all of this because the Bible tells us that not just there's a physical
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:00.480]   war going on, he says we have an enemy who's the devil, it's like a roaring lion seeking
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:07.480]   someone to devour. And Paul says in Galatians or Ephesians that we are in this spiritual
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:12.480]   battle constantly at war. And the moment that we forget that and we relax, that's when
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:19.480]   we are the most vulnerable. And we need to recognize the Bible clearly tells us that
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:24.480]   we're just passing through. This is not permanent. However great, however peaceful, however great
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:31.480]   the economy may be, this is all going to pass one day. And that Christ is going to come
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.480]   in his full glory and judgment is going to come with him and he's going to shake the
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:43.480]   earth and only those that remain he will be with in eternity. I remember again back then
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:48.480]   after 9/11 a few months, maybe about six, seven months afterwards, I was on campus at
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:53.480]   UCI and I was sharing the gospel and I met this young man and I started to share the
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:58.480]   gospel with him and his immediate response, and this was a common response from a lot
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:04.480]   of non-Christians at that time, "How can I believe in your God when you say he is so
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:09.480]   loving, how can a loving God allow 9/11 to happen?" And that was his response. And he
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:14.480]   was not the only person that said that. Anytime we would try to share the gospel, you probably
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.480]   have heard that too. If your God is so loving, why would he allow so much suffering in the
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:23.480]   world and at that particular time because the whole world was shaken up by what happened,
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:31.480]   how can God allow that? So I remember spending about 15 minutes trying to explain to him,
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:36.480]   "The God or the gospel that you heard is an incomplete gospel. In fact, the Bible does
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:41.480]   not start out by telling us how much he loves us. The Bible actually starts out by telling
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:47.480]   us how angry he is with the sinful world. He says, 'All have sinned and fall short of
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:52.480]   the glory of God. Wrath of God is being revealed against all unrighteousness.'" And as a
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.480]   result of that, if we die in our natural state that we're going to meet this holy God, then
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:02.480]   there's eternal judgment waiting. And so however tragic that may be or even more tragic
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:08.480]   things that you may have seen, the Bible says that's just a glimpse of what it means to
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:12.480]   live in this fallen world. And the judgment that's coming is going to be far more terrifying
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:17.480]   than anything that you have possibly imagined in human history. The Bible tells us that
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:23.480]   that's the state that mankind is in. But the gospel comes in. The good news is that
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:28.480]   despite that, that God sent his only begotten Son and absorbed the wrath that you and I
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   deserved upon the body of Jesus Christ. And he offers us that if we confess our sins,
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.480]   that he is faithful and just to forgive us of all our unrighteousness, that he will absorb
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:46.480]   that sin and give us eternal life and make us his adopted children. But when we understand
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:52.480]   the grace of God outside of the context of God's wrath, that question is the logical
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:58.480]   question that will come up. If he loves us so much, why did he create hell? If he loves
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:03.480]   us so much, why does 9/11 happen? If he loves us so much, why are there so many people
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:09.480]   suffering? Why are there sex trafficking? If he loves us so much. We have preached the
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:17.480]   gospel in fear of how people would respond and as a result of that, watered down the
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:23.480]   message of the cross to the point where it no longer makes logical sense. And in the
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:28.480]   church, we repeat it to each other so many times and it makes sense to us, but as soon
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.480]   as we go out on the street, we start challenging people and they start pushing back. We say,
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:36.480]   "Oh yeah, I never thought about that." But the problem is, the majority of the people
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.480]   in the church never engage in the non-Christian world, so you don't know what kind of holes
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:53.480]   you have in your logic. God is not universally, unconditionally satisfied with mankind. If
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:58.480]   we don't understand this, the gospel itself does not make sense. That's why even in the
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:03.480]   text that we're looking at, after explaining the grace of God to us, that we're not going
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.480]   to Mount Sinai, but we're headed to Mount Zion where there's a celebration of angels
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:13.480]   and multitudes gather together to worship Him, He concludes that section by saying,
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:23.480]   "Do not refuse Him." If those who refused Him, who spoke from earth, had serious consequences,
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:28.480]   how much more if you refuse Him who's speaking from heaven, who will shake not only the earth,
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:34.480]   but the heavens itself, that He will come and He will shake all things and bring judgment,
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:39.480]   how much more if we refuse Him and just kind of nonchalantly continue to neglect and to
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:48.480]   just drift away from Him? So, the proper response to grace that we were looking at is that we
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:54.480]   do not refuse Him. We take His word seriously. We understand the grace that we have in Christ.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:02.480]   And secondly, that we live for things that are not shakable. And then thirdly, the proper
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:09.480]   response to this grace is gratitude. In verse 28 it says, "Therefore, since we receive
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:15.480]   a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude." The proper response is gratitude.
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:19.480]   So, what I want to look at this morning is in this text it says, "What is the gratitude
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:25.480]   of Christians based on?" And it says clearly here, "Christian gratitude is not based
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:33.480]   on circumstance. It's not based upon material blessings that come and go. It's not based
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:42.480]   upon good health. It's not based upon a good relationship, your business doing well."
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:48.480]   See, the world knows how to be gracious and to have thanksgiving. And so, usually during
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.480]   thanksgiving when you say, "Well, what are you thankful for?" "Oh, I'm thankful
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:57.480]   for this new house that we bought. I thank you for my children who just got all A's.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:03.480]   I thank you for this stock that I invested in. It just went through the roof. I thank
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:08.480]   you for God answering my prayer who, you know, my brother, sister, mother, dad who was sick
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:14.480]   and they're not sick anymore." And so, if we're not careful, our attitude of gratitude
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:19.480]   is no different than the rest of the world. But he said, "Christian gratitude is based
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:29.480]   upon receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken." Eternal things, not things that come and go.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:34.480]   For one period it's true and one period it's not. He said, "Our gratitude is based
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   upon a kingdom that cannot be shaken." Daniel 2, 244, it says, "In the days of those
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:45.480]   kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed. And that kingdom
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:50.480]   will not be left for another people. It will crush and put an end of all these kingdoms,
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:59.480]   but it will itself endure forever." How much confidence do we put in the United States?
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:04.480]   In any kingdom? Maybe our family, our bank account. No, Christian gratitude is based
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:09.480]   upon things that are eternal, his kingdom. Hebrews 1, 8 it says, "But of the Son, he
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   says, your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the righteous scepter is of his kingdom."
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:23.480]   I mean, right now there's just so much uncertainty. Is the housing market going to crash or not?
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:28.480]   How about the economy? The inflation is through the roof. How can the stock market keep going
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:33.480]   up the way it is right now? So everybody's predicting maybe the economy is going to crash.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:38.480]   Are the Republicans and Democrats ever going to be able to come together? I mean, the chasm
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:44.480]   between the two, it seems so far out that the logical conclusion to this seems like
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:51.480]   some kind of a divorce. So is the United States going to be able to come together at some
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:59.480]   point? There's a lot of things that are more personal to you, your family, your health,
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:07.480]   your school, this pandemic. It's so many things that are uncertain. And our emotion,
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   if our hope is attached to these things, will go up and down, up and down based upon the
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:19.480]   local news, based upon your stock market, based upon your health and how your children
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:30.480]   are doing. But he says here, the natural response, the correct response to God's grace
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:37.480]   is gratitude. In Isaiah 40, 28-31, it says, "Do you not know, have you not heard, the
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.480]   everlasting God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of the earth, does not become weary
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:47.480]   or tired. His understanding is inscrutable. He gives strength to the weary, and to him
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   who lacks might, he increases power. Though youth grow weary and tired, and vigorous young
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:57.480]   men stumble badly, yet those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength." What does
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:02.480]   it mean to wait for the Lord? Just sit and do nothing? Does it mean wait for the Lord?
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:06.480]   It's like, don't do anything, don't move, don't say anything, just stay still. Well,
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:13.480]   the wait for the Lord here is related to the term in John chapter 15 when it says, "If
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:19.480]   you want to bear fruit, to remain in me, to be connected to him, to rely on him, to continue
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:25.480]   with him." So to wait upon the Lord basically means to not to anchor yourself to anything
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:33.480]   else, other than God and His promises. And those who have anchored their faith, anchored
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:40.480]   their life, anchored their joy in God, he says, they will renew their strength. They
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.480]   will mount up with wings like eagles. They will run and not get tired. They will walk
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:52.480]   and not become weary. When you read the prophecies of the Old Testament and the New Testament,
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:48:00.480]   they are not simple predictions. They're not predictions. God is not in His omniscient,
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:05.480]   looked way down in the history, and He saw the unfolding of human history, and He just
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:10.480]   wrote it down and said, "Hey, this is what's going to happen." That's not prophecy. That's
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.480]   the way you and I may naturally think. But prophecy in the Bible is basically God telling
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:23.480]   us what He's going to do. You see, if you've been in the political circle for any period,
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:31.480]   you probably lost confidence. Those of you who are new to voting and following politics
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:35.480]   and the next politician comes up and says, "I'm going to change the world. You don't
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:39.480]   have money. I'll give it to you. Your business isn't working. It's because of this guy.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:47.480]   But when I come in, it's going to change. Our lifespan is going to be longer. All the
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:51.480]   other countries are going to respect us. We're going to defeat all the other." I mean, they
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:55.480]   make promises like they're Jesus Himself. But if you've been in the political circle
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:49:01.480]   long enough, they say all of these things, and some of them may be very sincere. But
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:07.480]   once they get in to the office, every single one of them realize just how daunting this
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:13.480]   task is. They realize that they don't have as much control as they thought. The problem
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:19.480]   seems always simple until you actually try to deal with it. And I want you guys to remember
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:25.480]   that. This is kind of a side point. If you have a lot of opinions on things that you
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:33.480]   haven't ever really done yourself, I would say be humble. Because every politician that
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:37.480]   before they go into office, somebody's like, "Oh, just do this, one, two, three, and four,
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:41.480]   and everything will be great." But I think once they go in, they realize it's not as
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:45.480]   simple as they thought. The government is way more dysfunctional than they could possibly
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:51.480]   imagine. And you have two groups in power who is actively trying to destroy one another.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:55.480]   And they're like, "I'm not going to deal with that. I'm going to be true to it." But
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:50:03.480]   it's harder than they think. They get in there, and their human nature steps in. And
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:07.480]   they're afraid that if they say the wrong thing or not do the right thing, then they're
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:12.480]   not going to be elected for the next time that election comes. So they work very, very
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:17.480]   hard to politically stay safe so that they can get elected the next time. And that's
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:23.480]   the problem. And so whatever the reason is, whether they deliberately lied or whether
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:27.480]   they had good intention, once they get into power, they realize that they don't have a
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:34.480]   lot of control, even over themselves. I can tell you that next Sunday, I'll see you. And
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:42.480]   I guarantee I'm going to be here. Now, I may fully mean it, but I can't guarantee you.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:48.480]   Because I may get in a car accident today. I may have a heart attack. I may just change
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:55.480]   my mind. I'm not sure. I'm determined today, but tomorrow I wake up and say, "Ah, forget
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:51:02.480]   it. I don't want to do this anymore." So anything that is created, anything that man
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:10.480]   promises, is not on solid ground. That's why in the book of Titus, the text that we're
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.480]   studying together, it says in verse 1 and 2, "Paul, a bondservant of God, apostle of
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.480]   Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God, and the knowledge of the truth which
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:23.480]   is according to Godliness, in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:31.480]   long ages ago." That this salvation was given to us by an almighty, omniscient, omnipotent
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:41.480]   God, who cannot lie. Why is he saying that? He's telling us you can bank on it. That
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:47.480]   his promises were not just predictions. They're not wishful thoughts. He's telling us this
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:53.480]   is going to happen. So if you believe that, anchor yourself to that. If you don't believe
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:58.480]   it, obviously you're not going to anchor yourself. And that's what separates believers
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:06.480]   from unbelievers. True believers versus posers. You can say it, but your life and joy and
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:11.480]   hope is not really anchored in that. Hebrews chapter 6, 17, and 19, it says, "In the
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:16.480]   same way, God desiring even more to show the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   of his purpose, interposed with an oath, so that by two unchangeable things in which it
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:31.480]   is impossible for God to lie." Two things. His purpose and what he says cannot be changed
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   because God cannot lie. "We who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:42.480]   take hold of the hope that's set before us. Hope we have as an anchor of the soul,
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:48.480]   a hope both sure and steadfast, and one which enters within the veil." Christian gratitude
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:55.480]   is anchored in this hope. Our Thanksgiving isn't something that we try to look up every
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:59.480]   Thanksgiving time, like, "Oh, what am I thankful for?" Right? I'm thankful for my children,
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:03.480]   I'm thankful for this weather, I'm thankful for our leadership, I'm thankful for the
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:09.480]   church, and we're thankful for all these things that if we're not careful are just
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:17.480]   temporary. Ultimately, the core, the foundation of Christian gratitude is God and his kingdom
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:24.480]   that is unshakable. It will not change, even if the economy crashes. Maybe you just bought
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:30.480]   a house and the housing market tanks. Maybe you bought cryptocurrency and it goes to zero.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:36.480]   Maybe you've been putting money into your retirement and the stock market just tanks.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:42.480]   Maybe the U.S. government, because communism is rising, is no longer going to be the superpower
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:50.480]   and communism begins to come in. God forbid, but even if our worst nightmares happen,
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:57.480]   our anchor is secure in Christ. Our gratitude cannot be shaken.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:05.480]   See, in Luke chapter 10, 17-20, Jesus sends out the 70 disciples, two by two.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:11.480]   They come back skipping and rejoicing. It says, "The 70 return with joy, saying,
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:16.480]   'Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name.'" Imagine that.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:23.480]   Put yourself in their shoes. These are just commoners, fishermen, they weren't people of prominence.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:32.480]   The first time they were practically experiencing spiritual power, demons were shaking
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:38.480]   at their presence when they were praying. "Lord, even the demons are subject to your name."
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:42.480]   And Jesus said to them, "I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:48.480]   Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the powers of the enemy,
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:54.480]   and nothing will injure you." Imagine that excitement. Imagine if you came to Jesus excited about
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:00.480]   casting out demons and he says, "Scorpions." Like all the stuff, the satanic things that he's going to throw at you.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:05.480]   I've given you authority to overpower them. Can you imagine that?
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:11.480]   If Jesus said that to me, I would be walking through scorpions just to test this out.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:17.480]   You know what I mean? It's like, "Pipe me." It's like, "Oh, look at that."
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:24.480]   "But," he says, "nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you,
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.480]   but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven."
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:35.480]   As exciting as that may be, it is temporary.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:40.480]   It is temporary. God was, Jesus was trying to train them to rely on him.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:45.480]   But the rejoicing should not be in the fruits of your ministry,
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:50.480]   because they come and they go. Just like money, they come, they go.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:55.480]   Security comes and it goes. Relationships will come and it goes.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:56:01.480]   Whatever that is here, once God shakes things, nothing is permanent.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:06.480]   And you know, if you've lived any period of time, when you're young, anything good,
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.480]   you feel like you're going to have it forever, you live a little.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:13.480]   There's a reason why older people are more jaded, right?
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:17.480]   Because they've known your joy at one point.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:22.480]   And so older people are filled with disappointment.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:28.480]   So you don't see young people who are grizzled. It's usually old men who are grizzled.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:35.480]   You ever see, this is just off tangent for a little bit.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:41.480]   There's reasons why your parents don't have a lot of friends.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:46.480]   They had a lot of friends when they were young, just like you.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:52.480]   They had freshman gatherings, sophomore, sister appreciation night, brother appreciation.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:57.480]   They all, just like you. But they were hurt.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.480]   Somebody disappointed them. Somebody moved away from them.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:08.480]   Their heart was broken. The job that they were promised wasn't given to them.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.480]   The government disappointed them.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:16.480]   And so year after year after year of disappointment after disappointment after disappointment,
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:20.480]   and then one day you wake up, it's like, I don't trust anybody.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:24.480]   And if we're not careful, even when somebody comes to Christ, it's like, well, let's see.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:28.480]   Let's see how long this lasts.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:36.480]   That's years and years of disappointment from this world, from people, from economy, from politicians.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:42.480]   And he said, that's true, because the Bible says don't rejoice over that.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:47.480]   Because when it gets shaken, all of it will remind you it's temporary.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:54.480]   The reason why we get grizzled is because we place our confidence in things that we shouldn't have put confidence in.
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:58:00.480]   He said, rejoice if you're going to rejoice that your name is recorded in heaven.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:05.480]   C.S. Lewis in his book Weight of Glory says, "If we consider the unblushing promises of reward
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:08.480]   and the staggering nature of rewards promised in the Gospels,
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:13.480]   it would seem that our Lord finds our desires not too strong but too weak.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:20.480]   We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered to us.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:24.480]   Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:28.480]   because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at a sea,
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:32.480]   we are far too easily pleased."
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:38.480]   Let me ask you a tangible question.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:48.480]   If the proper response to grace is gratitude because we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken,
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:59:01.480]   how much of our rejoicing in Christ comes anywhere close to when your sports team wins a championship?
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.480]   Is it even close?
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:08.480]   Is it even a tenth of that?
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:18.480]   Because winning a championship in your favorite sports team is the mud pie.
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:20.480]   It's the mud pie.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.480]   It's a game.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.480]   You're not any richer for that.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:25.480]   Your life doesn't change for that.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:28.480]   Your children aren't better because of that.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:31.480]   But it's not wrong. It's not sinful.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:33.480]   It's just mud pie.
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:39.480]   In relation to our worship before God, when we think of what He has given us,
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:45.480]   what has been sacrificed in order for you and I to be here to worship Him,
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:48.480]   does it even compare?
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:52.480]   In Psalm 1611 it says, "You will make known to me the path of life.
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:55.480]   In your presence is fullness of joy.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:59.480]   In your right hand there are pleasures forever."
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.480]   If you believe that statement, you will anchor yourself to the statement
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:07.480]   and live and invest based upon this promise.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:15.480]   Because ultimately the greatest satisfaction, the greatest refuge, is found in the unshakable promise of Christ.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:20.480]   Because the King is unshakable, so therefore the kingdom is unshakable.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.480]   That's the basis of Christian gratitude.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.480]   Not because my friends love me.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.480]   Not because I have better health.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.480]   Not because the economy is doing better.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.480]   Not because the right person is in leadership.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:41.480]   But because I have a King who rules over a kingdom that cannot be shaken.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:46.480]   If we understand that, if we embrace that, what does this gratitude lead to?
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:49.480]   He says, "Therefore since we have received a kingdom which cannot be shaken,
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:55.480]   let us show gratitude by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe,
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.480]   for our God is a consuming fire."
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:03.480]   The grounds in which we have gratitude is an unshakable kingdom.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:11.480]   But once we have gratitude, he says, it leads to by which we offer to God an acceptable service.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.480]   The word for service here is the word "Letruo."
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:21.480]   So if you've been here for a while, you know that I've given this message probably about two or three times in the church.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:25.480]   The most prominent word for worship in the Greek is "proskeneo."
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:29.480]   Proskeneo basically means to be prostrated.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.480]   It's kind of a scene of somebody bowing down and kissing the feet of the King.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.480]   Because you're in awe of something greater than you.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.480]   Most of the times when you see the word "worship" in the New Testament, it's that word "proskeneo."
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.480]   Prostrated, surrendered.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:49.480]   You are beyond what I can imagine, and that's proskeneo.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.480]   The second word is the word "sabomai."
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.480]   Sabomai basically means to have reverence, internal reverence and awe toward God.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.480]   So when the Bible says, "Render more than your garments, but your very hearts,"
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:07.480]   that's what he's referring to, that proper adoration ought to be more than just external service.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:12.480]   The word here, "letruo," has an idea of the actual service.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.480]   In the Old Testament, in the Septuagint, the word that was used here
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:21.480]   to describe the service at the temple by the priest was the word "letruo."
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:28.480]   In the New Testament, that word is described as our Christian living, as an act of worship.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.480]   And that's what's described in Romans 12, verse 1.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.480]   That same word is used here.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:38.480]   It says, "Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice,
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:44.480]   acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship, letruo."
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:59.480]   So, if gratitude is what leads to acceptable service, ingratitude is what leads to unacceptable service.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.480]   You understand what I'm saying?
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:08.480]   So at the core of everything that we do, if it is not an overflow of appreciation of what God has done,
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.480]   so therefore I volunteer to give worship through this way,
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:20.480]   and if you're doing this, "I've got to do this, I've got to do that," that's not worship.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.480]   That's not worship.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:28.480]   I've been in Bible studies where, I mean, I probably had --
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:32.480]   I remember one time I was in Bible study in Garden Grove and I went to somebody's apartment,
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:40.480]   and I could tell not a single person there wanted to be in the Bible study.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.480]   None of you were there, so don't worry, okay?
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:48.480]   And I could tell as soon as I walked in, they wanted to get that over with.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:52.480]   Even before we started, get it over with because they had plans to do something.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.480]   They wanted to have a game night.
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.480]   They wanted to do this and that.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:04:01.480]   And so I'm like opening up the Bible study, and like right off the bat I'm like, "Oh, my gosh.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.480]   This next hour and a half is going to be torturous."
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:09.480]   Sure enough, right off the bat, just a glazed look.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.480]   If I said anything that sounded like I was going to go a little bit longer,
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:16.480]   it's almost like anger in their eyes.
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.480]   I could have literally just mumbled for the next 30 minutes, and it would have made a difference,
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.480]   just as long as it was short.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.480]   It was just torture, torture for them, torture for me.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:33.480]   I've given sermons like that at churches where people are flipping through magazines while I was preaching.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:40.480]   And usually I would try to mix up the sermon and try to get their attention, but I just had no desire.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.480]   So I made it harder and more boring.
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.480]   You don't care anyway.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:52.480]   Yeah, I got to fix that.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:05:02.480]   But there's the difference between a worship that is given out of gratitude versus something that you're like, "You better do it.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.480]   Remember, you better do it.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.480]   You want to serve, you better do it."
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:18.480]   So he says it is by this gratitude, recognizing what it is that we have in Christ, is what leads to acceptable worship.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:25.480]   That's why what God wants is a cheerful giver, not just a giver, not just the amount, a cheerful giver,
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.480]   because he wants an act of worship.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.480]   And Psalm 104 to 5 is, "Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.480]   Give thanks and bless his name, for the Lord is good.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:40.480]   His loving kindness is everlasting and his faithfulness to all generations."
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.480]   You know what's interesting?
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:49.480]   In Luke 17, 17-19, that's the story that Jesus gives about he meets 10 lepers,
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:53.480]   and then he tells the 10 that they're begging, "Lord, please, please heal us, heal us."
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:57.480]   And Jesus says, "Go show yourself to the priests at the temple."
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:03.480]   So if you remember the book of Leviticus, it says that in order for the lepers to enter back into society,
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:08.480]   the lepers had to be examined by the priests, and the priests have to give a stamp of approval,
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.480]   saying that, "Okay, the healing has taken place."
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:20.480]   And once they are approved by the priests, then they're able to come back into worship and into regular society.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:26.480]   Jesus says to the 10 lepers, "Go and show yourself to the priests," and on their way, they all receive healing.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.480]   The 10 of them continue to go, and they just disappear.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:33.480]   One of them, if you remember, he comes back, and he thanks Jesus.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.480]   But here's the interesting thing about this.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:42.480]   If you look at verse 17, it says, "Jesus answered and said, 'Were there not 10 cleansed, but the 9? Where are they?
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:47.480]   Was no one found to return to give glory to God except the foreigner?'
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:53.480]   And he said to him, 'Stand up and go. Your faith has made you well.'"
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.480]   All 10 of them were made well.
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.480]   Why does he say to just that one that returned?
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.480]   What about them?
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:05.480]   Clearly, he's not talking about just his physical healing.
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:13.480]   His gratitude that he returned back to give God the glory was evidence of true healing.
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.480]   That's what he means here.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:20.480]   Gratitude is the proper response in which we give acceptable worship.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:23.480]   Isn't that exactly what it says in John 4:23?
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:28.480]   "An hour is coming, and now is when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth.
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.480]   For such people the Father seeks to be his worshipers.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:37.480]   God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.480]   God is not looking for the smartest people.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.480]   He's not looking for the most disciplined.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.480]   He's not looking for the most gifted.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:47.480]   He's not looking for the hardest worker or the most experienced.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.480]   He's looking for true worshipers.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:53.480]   People who recognize what they have in Christ.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:58.480]   People who've seen and experienced the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:04.480]   And so all that they do is a response to that.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.480]   He's not looking for the smartest people.
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.480]   In fact, remember the Corinthians?
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.480]   They're all trying to be one up each other.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.480]   Oh, Peter, Apollos is the smart one.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.480]   Paul is the hard worker.
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.480]   Peter was the first leader.
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.480]   Remember how Paul addresses them?
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:20.480]   Not many of you were smart.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:23.480]   In fact, God chose you because you were dumb.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.480]   That's kind of humbling, right?
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:27.480]   And that's the modern translation.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.480]   That's basically what he was saying.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.480]   You guys are all trying to one up each other, trying to be so smart.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.480]   You were chosen because you were dumb.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.480]   You're trying to be somebody in the church.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.480]   God chose you because you were nobody.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.480]   You forgot that?
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:45.480]   And you're trying to be somebody in the church, and that's what's causing all this division.
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:49.480]   Remember, stay dumb for Christ.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:53.480]   That's modern translation.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:56.480]   God's not looking for the smartest.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:59.480]   Not to say you can't be smart.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.480]   Not to say you shouldn't work hard.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:09.480]   But the primary thing that he's looking for are people who have been affected by this grace.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:12.480]   And you respond by gratitude.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:19.480]   By this gratitude, you serve him and you worship him in spirit and in truth.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:29.480]   But the greatest struggle that you and I have is the constant, constant distraction from this world.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.480]   John Piper, in his book, "Hunger for God," we read that as a church.
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:40.480]   He says this, "The greatest enemy of hunger for God is not poison but apple pie.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:45.480]   It is not the banquet of the wicked that dulls our appetite for heaven, but endless nibbling at the table of the world.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:53.480]   It is not the X-rated video but the prime-time drivel of triviality we drink in every night."
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:10:03.480]   It is a constant distraction that makes the things that are glorious just mundane.
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.480]   A habit.
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.480]   Why did we come here this morning?
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.480]   Because it's Sunday.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.480]   That's what we do.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.480]   That's what we've been doing.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.480]   What are you doing Wednesday?
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.480]   It's Wednesday. It's Bible study time.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.480]   That's what we do.
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:23.480]   The word "holy" literally means to be set apart.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.480]   When we typically think of holy, we think morally holy.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.480]   But the word in itself simply means to be set apart.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:35.480]   That's why in the Old Testament, God would take a bowl and dedicate it to the temple, and it became holy.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:40.480]   A bowl became holy because it was set apart from that which was common.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.480]   You would take an animal that was just hanging around with all the other animals,
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:50.480]   and all of a sudden you set it apart as a sacrifice to God, and then it became holy.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.480]   So no one was able to touch that because once it was set apart, it belonged to God.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.480]   It's no longer common.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:00.480]   So that's what the word "holy" means.
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:07.480]   So everything that we do that just becomes a habit is no longer holy.
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.480]   It's just common.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:13.480]   Because it's just habitual.
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:16.480]   Worship is not something that we give because you showed up.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:22.480]   Worship is something that we give because we've been affected by His glory.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.480]   Glory, the word in itself, means weighty.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.480]   That's what the word literally means.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:34.480]   That when we beheld His glory, we saw something that was very serious.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:38.480]   It was something very weighty.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:44.480]   So the word "holy" and the word "glory," the word in and of itself,
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:53.480]   causes us to be set apart from everything that is common, everything that is habitual.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.480]   I mentioned this to you before.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.480]   I don't like wearing suits.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:04.480]   In fact, I have friends who think I'm weird for wearing suits.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.480]   I don't like wearing suits.
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:09.480]   They say, "Just take it off. Don't be so legalistic."
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:13.480]   If you've ever met me during the weekday,
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:21.480]   nine out of ten times I have a black T-shirt on with a jean or a gray one.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.480]   And I have about 15 of those.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:29.480]   To me, it's just a waste of time to think about what I'm going to put on,
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.480]   so it's the easiest thing to do.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.480]   So even on Sunday when I put suits on,
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.480]   the only thing that enters my mind is, "What didn't I not wear last week?"
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:41.480]   That's the only thought that enters my mind when I choose which suit to wear.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.480]   Why do I wear it?
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:46.480]   And I've had somebody tell me, "Hey, man, calm down.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.480]   This is California. Hang loose, buddy."
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:56.480]   Because I don't want Sunday to be common.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:01.480]   I don't want the handling of the Word of God to be common.
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:05.480]   I don't want our corporate worship to be no different
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:10.480]   than when we went to watch a movie at AMC.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.480]   It should be different.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.480]   It should be set apart.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.480]   We shouldn't walk in here like you walk into any assembly.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.480]   This is not just any assembly.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:22.480]   This is a gathering of the ones who have been set apart
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:25.480]   to worship a holy, holy, holy God.
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.480]   It should not be common.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.480]   It should not be pedestrian.
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:33.480]   And so when we recognize who it is that we worship,
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:39.480]   and His glory affects us, and it causes us to be grateful,
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:43.480]   and this gratefulness causes me to pursue sanctification,
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:46.480]   pursue love,
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:49.480]   that's what the Bible says that He is doing.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.480]   He is actively looking for people who will worship in spirit
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.480]   and in truth.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.480]   That's what He's looking for.
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.480]   But here's something weird.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:06.480]   He said, "Okay, His grace affects us in this way."
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:09.480]   But then here, He ends it with, "To give an acceptable service,
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:14.480]   which with reverence and awe for our God is a consuming fire."
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:19.480]   That's a weird way to end the response to grace,
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.480]   "consuming fire."
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:24.480]   Is He talking about like a campfire?
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.480]   At least very soothing?
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:29.480]   Enjoy His fire.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:32.480]   Get your marshmallow ready.
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:35.480]   Because we worship in gratitude because He's given us grace
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:41.480]   in His unshakable kingdom because our God is a campfire.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:44.480]   That's not what it means.
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.480]   He said we ought to give God our gratitude,
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.480]   acceptable worship because of His grace,
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.480]   because our God is a consuming fire.
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:55.480]   Consuming fire in the Bible refers to His judgment,
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.480]   His holiness.
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:01.480]   It almost is like, "Huh, that's a weird way to end that."
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.480]   If your understanding of grace of God was outside of the
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:08.480]   understanding, the wrath, and the holiness of God,
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:11.480]   then the natural question that you probably is asking,
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.480]   "Why does a loving God do all of this?"
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.480]   Just like that non-Christian, why would a loving God cause us
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.480]   to say He's a consuming fire at the end of telling us how
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.480]   gracious He is?
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:28.480]   See, His grace and His love must be understood in the context of
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:36.480]   His wrath and His judgment or else His grace is just cheap grace.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.480]   Let me conclude with this.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.480]   In Philippians 2, 9, 13, it says,
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:43.480]   "For this reason, after Jesus has humbled Himself and was
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.480]   crucified on the cross, for this reason also God highly exalted
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.480]   Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name so
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.480]   that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow,
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:55.480]   of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.480]   and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:01.480]   Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:06.480]   So then, so then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed,
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:10.480]   not as in my presence only but much more in my absence,
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:16.480]   work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is God
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.480]   who works in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure."
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:23.480]   I don't know how many conversations I've had with
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:29.480]   people who said, "That cannot mean this because it doesn't fit
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:31.480]   the gospel that they've embraced.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.480]   It doesn't fit the idea that they've created in their own
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.480]   head about who God is.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.480]   Why would He tell New Testament, New Covenant people who have
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.480]   been washed in the blood of Christ to work out your
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:46.480]   salvation in fear and trembling?"
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:52.480]   Possibly the gospel that you have heard was not complete.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:58.480]   Possibly the idea that you have of God wasn't complete.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:03.480]   The grace of God has to be understood in the consuming
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:05.480]   fire of God.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.480]   And that's why he says, "Considering this grace,
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.480]   do not refuse Him who is speaking from heaven because as
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:17.480]   He shakes the earth and the heavens," and we recognize that
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:20.480]   at the end of this we have been given a kingdom that cannot be
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:27.480]   shaken, that by it we give Him gratitude,
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:33.480]   which is the basis of acceptable worship in spirit of awe and
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:40.480]   reverence because our God is a consuming fire.
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:45.480]   Do not take the grace of God for granted or else you will turn
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:49.480]   the grace of God into cheap grace and nothing more.
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:50.480]   Amen?
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:18:00.480]   Let's pray.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.480]   Again, as our worship team comes,
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:05.480]   let's take some time to seek the Lord.
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:10.480]   If we have made the things of God common,
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:16.480]   our walk with God habitual, if the mud pies in our life bring
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:21.480]   more satisfaction than the glory of God,
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.480]   let's take some time to pray and ask the Lord,
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:25.480]   "Lord, search me and know me.
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.480]   See if there's any hurtful ways in me.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:30.480]   I want to worship you in spirit and in truth," and ask the Lord's
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.480]   help to remain in it.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.480]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.

[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.480]   Let's pray.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:23.480]   Psalm 121 says, "I will lift up my eyes to the mountains.
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.480]   From where shall my help come?
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:28.480]   My help comes from the Lord who made heaven and earth.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.480]   He will not allow your foot to slip.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.480]   He who keeps you will not slumber.
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:37.480]   Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.480]   The Lord is your keeper.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.480]   The Lord is your shade on your right hand.
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:44.480]   The sun will not smite you by day nor the moon by night.
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.480]   The Lord will protect you from all evil.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.480]   He will keep your soul.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:51.480]   The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:54.480]   from this time forth and forever."
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:58.480]   Lord, we pray that this promise, Lord God,
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.480]   will be ours this week.
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:02.480]   That we will be anchored in Christ.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:04.480]   That we would not neglect or drift away, Father God,
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.480]   from the grace that you've given us.
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:11.480]   May Christ and his name be magnified wherever you send us this week.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:13.480]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:18.480]   God sent his Son
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:23.480]   They called him Jesus
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:28.480]   He came to love
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:33.480]   Heal and forgive
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:38.480]   He lived and died
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:43.480]   To buy my pardon
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:48.480]   An empty grave is there to prove
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:52.480]   My Savior lived
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:57.480]   Because he lived
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:02.480]   I can face tomorrow
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:07.480]   Because he lived
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.480]   All fear is gone
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:17.480]   Because I know
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:22.480]   He holds the future
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:26.480]   And life is worth the living
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:33.480]   Just because he lived
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.480]   Amen.
